# Designing sustainable patient-centered innovation pathways: An introduction for responsible innovators




## Preface


Healthcare innovation holds immense potential to improve lives, yet many promising ideas never reach the patients who need them most. As an educator and researcher at TU Delft, I have seen how technical breakthroughs often struggle to scale beyond prototypes, failing to integrate into hospital systems or national healthcare policies. This challenge is not just technical, it is fundamentally entrepreneurial.

This realization led me to develop and teach a course on healthcare entrepreneurship, aimed at equipping students with the knowledge and skills to navigate this complex landscape. Over the years, I have seen how a multidisciplinary, interactive approach fosters a deeper understanding of what it takes to bring healthcare innovations to market. However, I also recognized the limitations of traditional classroom teaching. I wanted to extend this learning experience to a much wider audience, both at TU Delft and beyond.

**The Aim of This Book**

This book is designed as an actionable methodology for innovators working in the trenches of healthcare organizations. Whether you are a care professional, patient, hospital manager, health insurer, startup founder, policymaker, researcher, or simply someone passionate about improving healthcare, this handbook is meant to empower you to drive change.

By combining expert panel discussions, interactive quizzes, and discussion forums, this book seeks to replicate and enhance the interactive learning experience of the classroom. Instead of passively consuming information, readers are encouraged to engage, reflect, and discuss—just as they would in a face-to-face setting.

The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between healthcare innovators and real-world adoption. This book provides practical tools to help innovators understand how to scale their solutions, navigate complex healthcare systems, secure funding, and integrate new technologies within existing infrastructures.

**Who Should Read This Book?**

This handbook is for anyone committed to transforming healthcare through innovation, including:

* Care professionals and patients seeking to improve healthcare delivery from within.

## Introduction

**Why This Book?**

If another pandemic were to break out tomorrow, what would you do?

During the COVID-19 crisis, we witnessed unprecedented, rapid, and coordinated innovation efforts at every level of the healthcare system. Stakeholders from across the sector—patients, clinicians, researchers, regulators, and policymakers—mobilized to develop new solutions in record time. This included:

* Temperature measurement solutions
* Sanitizing alcohol solutions
* Mask production and distribution
* Large-scale vaccination centers
* *apid lab analysis techniques
* Fast-tracked vaccine development, regulatory approval, and market access

However, once the crisis subsided, many of these integrated innovation pathways dissolved. Today, healthcare innovation continues, but often in fragmented and incremental ways rather than through large-scale transformational efforts.

For example, some efforts focus on human-centered patient experiences by enhancing electronic medical records and health data transparency, yet these solutions often remain siloed within specific institutions. There are also rapidly changing landscapes  in emerging fields in intervention discovery and development and new ways of delivering care with biotech and ICT: e.g. synthetic, genetic, and cellular laboratory techniques, machine learning, additive manufacturing, extended reality, theranostics. 

Some innovations are also coming from other industries into healthcare, technological advances such as medical drones for transporting blood and emergency equipment require harmonization of legislation, technology, infrastructure, and care pathways before they can be widely implemented (MAVLab, 2023; Helicus, 2023; TU Delft, 2023). Consider, for example, the ambulance drone concept—an unmanned aircraft that delivers defibrillators to cardiac arrest patients within minutes. While technically feasible, the innovation pathway from prototype to scalable, integrated solution remains unclear. What financial models, regulatory approvals, and operational frameworks are needed to bring such an idea to real-world implementation?

[![Ambulance drone - Future Health Project](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dhj6OZj4kB3k)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj6OZj4kB3k)


This handbook aims to bridge this gap, equipping you with the tools and frameworks to design and implement scalable, sustainable innovation pathways in healthcare.

**The Need for Designing Innovation Pathways into Practice**

We need to train the future generation of responsible health innovators to ensure that their innovations achieve real impact. This is especially true for digital health, which is expected to become a cornerstone of healthcare transformation in the coming decade (Friend et al., 2023; Weimar et al., 2024; Technology Foresight, n.d.). However, despite its potential, most digital health solutions fail to integrate meaningfully into healthcare systems (Lee et al., 2021).

A recent review of digital healthcare innovation found that efforts focus primarily on making existing care processes more efficient, rather than driving structural transformation (Kraus et al., 2021). As a result, only a small number of digital tools—such as online data-sharing platforms and video consultations—have gained widespread adoption, despite these technologies existing for decades. Compared to other heavily regulated industries like retail (which integrates well-being and prevention programs) or aerospace (which advances medical logistics via unmanned aircraft), healthcare's digital transformation is lagging (Compton-Phillips, 2024).

Even within leading technology-driven institutions like TU Delft, students are often trained to develop novel technological solutions from an outsider’s perspective (a “technology push” approach). However, they struggle to connect these inventions to real-world healthcare challenges, as they lack formal training in innovation management, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory integration (Smulders et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2021).

To address these issues, we must train future innovators to design holistic innovation pathways—structured approaches that front-load the knowledge of diverse stakeholders to develop solutions that are:

Scalable, meaning they can transition from small-scale pilots to widespread adoption
Sustainable, both financially and environmentally, ensuring long-term impact
Stakeholder-driven, integrating patient, clinician, and policymaker insights from the outset

**The Key to Holistic Innovation Pathways: Front-Loading Stakeholder Knowledge**

One of the most critical elements in designing effective innovation pathways is integrating diverse stakeholder knowledge at the very beginning of the innovation process. Healthcare innovation is inherently fragmented, with different stakeholders holding tacit knowledge that is often siloed and difficult to access.

A major factor in early-stage innovation failure is that potential problems are only identified late in the process—often after significant investment has been made. To increase the likelihood of success, we must front-load these challenges, bringing together key actors at the start to anticipate roadblocks and co-create viable pathways forward.

We need to integrate different stakeholder's knowledge by facilitating social interaction processes that bring together entrepreneurs, researchers, patients, care professionals, technology experts, and policymakers. This collaborative approach ensures that innovations do not remain theoretical but instead find practical application in real-world healthcare systems.

By integrating stakeholder knowledge effectively, we can design innovation pathways that are not only technically and economically feasible but also socially and environmentally sustainable. This is the approach that this book aims to equip you with—providing the tools, frameworks, and methodologies needed to move from invention to integration in healthcare innovation.

**Key Learning Outcomes**

This book will help you achieve the following learning objectives:

* Analyze and map innovation pathways for in-house ventures within hospitals, effectively leveraging key resources such as patients, care professionals, and executives to drive decision-making and implementation.
* Develop validation strategies within an innovation pathway, aligning with research methodologies, ethical review processes, and policy requirements to ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., Belgium’s 2023 digital therapeutics regulation NEEDS REFERENCE).
* Formulate financial strategies as part of an innovation pathway, integrating diverse funding sources such as hospital investments, reimbursement models, research grants, patient organizations, and corporate partnerships to support long-term viability.
* Design structured and sustainable innovation pathways for team-based healthcare innovation projects, ensuring feasibility, real-world impact within the health system, and environmental sustainability.

**How to Use This Book**

This handbook provides an actionable methodology for healthcare innovators working within hospitals, startups, government agencies, and academia. It is designed to empower professionals at all levels—from frontline healthcare workers to policymakers—to take an entrepreneurial approach to solving systemic challenges.

You may already be more entrepreneurial than you think. Whether you are a clinician rethinking patient workflows, a hospital administrator piloting new digital tools, or a researcher translating discoveries into practical applications, healthcare needs your innovation now more than ever. The sector faces multiple global crises—staffing shortages, planetary health concerns, and worsening health outcomes. Addressing these challenges requires diverse perspectives and collaborative efforts.

The book is structured to integrate theory with practice, ensuring you gain actionable insights rather than abstract knowledge. Each section includes:

* Real-world case studies illustrating key challenges and solutions
* Interactive exercises and reflection prompts to help you apply concepts
* Embedded videos and discussion forums (available online) to foster community learning

Whether you are a health professional, entrepreneur, policymaker, or student, this book will empower you with the tools to create lasting impact in healthcare innovation.

  </div>
</center>
<br>


**The Relevance of a Vision**

A vision serves as a guiding principle, offering direction and purpose to individuals and organizations striving for change. It helps to inspire and align stakeholders, ensuring that efforts are coordinated and impactful. In the context of healthcare, a strong vision is essential for fostering sustainable innovation that meets societal needs.

A powerful example of the importance of a unified vision can be seen in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis created a global mission that brought together stakeholders from various industries—healthcare, technology, logistics, and policymaking—who had never collaborated on this scale before. This urgency led to the rapid development and deployment of new solutions, such as temperature measurement systems, sanitizing technologies, personal protective equipment, and vaccines. The pandemic demonstrated that when there is a shared vision, innovation pathways become more integrated and effective, enabling faster and more impactful solutions. Without a collective vision, efforts can become fragmented, leading to slower progress and inefficiencies.

**Vision vs. Strategy vs. Plan**

While often used interchangeably, a vision, a strategy, and a plan each play distinct roles in driving innovation:

* Vision is the overarching purpose or desired future state. It is broad, aspirational, and inspiring.

* Strategy is a more concrete roadmap outlining how to achieve the vision. It includes the key decisions and directions to take.

* Plan is the most specific, detailing the step-by-step actions required to implement the strategy.

By establishing a compelling vision, innovators can align strategies and plans to create meaningful change.

**Key elements to consider in your vision**

I believe we need to work toward sustainable healthcare and healing environments, through which people can practice a healing mindfulness experience. Meditation and mindfulness can be powerful tools in healthcare, not only for patients but also for healthcare professionals to manage stress and improve well-being.

A holistic approach to healthcare innovation should integrate sustainability, patient-centered design, and cutting-edge technologies. This includes intervention discovery and development in biotech and ICT, such as synthetic, genetic, and cellular laboratory techniques, machine learning, additive manufacturing, extended reality, theranostics, and unmanned medical aircraft. Holistic innovation pathways should incorporate diverse stakeholders, ensuring that solutions are scalable, sustainable, and impactful.

One way to develop your vision about the future of healthcare is to develop a story that is compelling to you and reflect on the underlying ethical and societal values for you.

**Developing Your Own Vision: Tips and Strategies**

* Developing a personal vision for healthcare requires deep reflection on your values, aspirations, and societal needs. Here are some strategies to help:

* Identify Core Ethical Values: Reflect on what matters most to you—equity, sustainability, patient empowerment, or accessibility?

* Observe Current Healthcare Challenges: What problems do you want to solve? What gaps exist in the current system?

* Think Beyond the Present: Imagine a radically different future—how could healthcare look in 20 or 50 years?

* Engage with Diverse Perspectives: Speak with patients, care professionals, policymakers, and innovators to broaden your understanding.

Use Storytelling: A compelling vision is often best communicated through narrative. Storytelling helps translate abstract ideas into tangible and relatable concepts.

**Sci-Fi Storyline Mapping Exercise by Lavinia Marin**

A creative way to develop and refine your healthcare vision is through Sci-Fi storyline mapping. This method, developed by Lavinia Marin (TU Delft) & Gitte van Helden (TU Delft), encourages thinking about the future of healthcare through speculative fiction. It allows innovators to anticipate challenges, ethical dilemmas, and societal transformations that may arise.

**How to Use the Sci-Fi Storyline Mapping Exercise:**

* Start with a Writing Prompt: Choose a thought-provoking prompt that relates to healthcare innovation. For example:

        What if hospitals no longer existed? How would healthcare be delivered?

        Imagine a world where AI and robotics handle 90% of medical diagnoses. How does this impact the doctor-patient relationship?

        In 2050, healthcare is entirely personalized through genetic modification. What are the ethical and societal implications?

* Develop a Short Story: Use your imagination to build a scenario around the prompt. Include characters, settings, conflicts, and resolutions that highlight the key themes of your vision.

* Extract Ethical and Societal Values: After writing the story, reflect on what ethical principles and societal values emerged. Did your story emphasize equity, sustainability, or human-centered care?

        Sustainability
        Efficiency
        Compassion
        Solidarity
        Knowledge
        Innovation
        Survival 
        Health
        Well-being
        Resilience 
        Profit
        Beauty 


* Refine Your Vision Statement: Based on your insights, articulate a more refined and actionable vision for healthcare innovation.

**Why Is Healthcare Innovation So Hard?**

Healthcare innovation is notoriously challenging due to multiple structural, regulatory, and behavioral barriers. As outlined by Herzlinger (2006) in "Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard," several factors contribute to this difficulty. 

Please read the article: "Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard": In this seminal article, Herzlinger identifies several systemic barriers that make healthcare innovation particularly difficult. She argues that the complexity of healthcare systems, coupled with regulatory constraints, misaligned incentives, and risk-averse stakeholders, creates a challenging environment for new innovations to thrive. The article highlights key factors contributing to these difficulties, such as fragmented healthcare markets, resistance to disruptive change, and the challenge of balancing scientific rigor with market-driven entrepreneurial strategies. Herzlinger emphasizes the need for strategic alignment between policymakers, investors, and healthcare providers to foster an ecosystem conducive to sustainable innovation.

**Key aspects to take into account**:
* Lack of Entrepreneurial Strategy: Many promising innovations fail to achieve long-term impact due to the absence of a strategic entrepreneurial approach. Without a clear business model, funding strategy, and implementation plan, innovations remain underutilized.

* Scientific vs. Entrepreneurial Behavior: The healthcare system is predominantly driven by scientific discoveries, which often lack integration with entrepreneurial mindsets necessary for commercialization and widespread adoption.

* Transdisciplinary Complexity: Innovation in healthcare requires expertise spanning multiple disciplines, including:

        Management and strategy

        Organizational sciences

        Health sciences and economics

        Technology sciences

        Patient expertise

        Law and regulations

        Ethics

        Human-centered and strategic design

        Entrepreneurship

* Beyond Organizational Boundaries: Healthcare innovation inherently spans across organizations and multiple stages of the innovation process. It involves collaboration between fundamental research institutions (e.g., universities) and clinical practice, necessitating coordinated efforts for successful implementation.

By adopting a strategic entrepreneurial approach, healthcare organizations can overcome these challenges and drive impactful innovations. This requires fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, developing clear implementation pathways, and aligning technological advancements with patient-centered needs and market viability.

   Learning goal: understand how differences between socio-technical product service systems on different levels impact health innovation
  </div>
</center>
<br>

**Definition: Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS)**

Sociotechnical systems theory, as initially developed by Trist (1981), emphasizes the mutual shaping of social and technical elements within an organization. This approach is particularly pertinent to healthcare, where the interaction between human actors (e.g., healthcare providers, patients) and technical components (e.g., medical devices, health information systems) is complex and dynamic. Appelbaum (1997) further elaborates on the application of STS theory in organizational development, highlighting how it can drive innovation and improvement in healthcare settings.

Venturing into systems where value is created for users through different stakeholders and multiple interrelated services and products, such as in healthcare, public services, hospitality, and aerospace, is challenging. These systems are known as Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS). In STPSS, each stakeholder possesses explicable knowledge about their role and the system's functionality. Explicable knowledge, defined as implicit knowledge that can be made explicit during social interaction (Smulders, Lousberg & Dorst, 2008), forms a chain where products and services are interrelated. According to sociotechnical systems theory (Trist, 1981; Appelbaum, 1997), STPSS involves several individuals who shape a piece of technology or a product, or both, assigned to them within their own workplaces, creating an integrated chain of product-service value deliveries at the system level.

To operationalize this term in today's context where technology assumes many complex forms, we have added the product-service systems specification. This helps describe the complex environments in which today’s entrepreneurs operate. Entrepreneurs face significant challenges in developing an integrated new venture idea (NVI) that spans the entire value chain within an STPSS. Integrating the explicable knowledge of diverse stakeholders into an NVI is crucial, yet there has been little emphasis on the social process of knowledge interaction in NVI development.



**Role of Stakeholders and Evolving Technology**

In a socio-technical product service system, there is an interaction between technology and people (e.g., electronic medical records). Understanding the healthcare STPSS, its actors, and their interdependencies is crucial. The open course on patient journey mapping at TU Delft provides foundational knowledge about the sociotechnical context of healthcare systems. Watch the initial videos here. 

TA make videos clear here: https://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/design-healthcare-using-patient-journey-mapping/?view=lectures&subject=22696


These interactions can be visualized by the social determinants (Ramirez, 2008). 

Some key factors influencing our haealth for instace are education, income and age for instance. And all of the problems people face with their health are increasingly being mitigated by technology. To get a good grasp on the impact of our societies on our health take a look at the TED talk video "How not to be ignorant about the world" by Hans and Ola Rosling. Please follow the quiz questions actively, which are posed in the video, can you do better then the audience?:

**Value Creation in a Socio-Technical Health System**

The current landscape could be currently categorized into four key actors: patients, health care providers, regulators and third party payers. This value provision pathway could be described by looking at the relationships between these stakeholders. See this figure by Kraus: 

```{figure} ./figures/Kraus-21_Digital-transformation-traditional-Fig1.jpg
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

Stakeholders in a traditional healthcare system (Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.)
```


Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.

However, this landscape is changing. Increasingly new initiatives, like digital healthcare solutions, change the way value is created (Kraus, 2021). For instance,  a solution may not need a physical healthcare provider, the patient could self-manage, validate with an external care professional and treat a certain problem themselves. The system itself is changing as well. For example, remote healthcare solutions operate differently if the institutions are involved in a different way. For instance, new communication software or data infrastucture (5G) could allow each actor to play a different role.

Value in a socio-technical health system is created through the connection of different products and services. Over the past decades, the vision of value-based healthcare has influenced the health system, as value creation is increasingly discussed. Different methods of creating care, providing value to patients, and rewarding the value created (rather than merely the intervention) have been explored.

**Geographical Differences in Health Systems**

Different countries have varying approaches to health insurance, coverage, and reimbursement for medical interventions:

* European Perspective (Bettina Maisch, Ines): Predominantly public, with national insurance schemes and stringent medical device regulations. Countries like Germany and France have universal health coverage with a mix of public funding and private insurance options for supplemental services. The European Union also has regulations such as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the proposed AI Act, which impact MedTech innovation.

Check this open courseware TU Delft course about EUROPEAN medical device regulation: https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/medical-devices-regulation-in-practice/

(TA Check access to videos)

* Dutch Perspective: A mix of public and private insurance, with mandatory health coverage regulated by the government. Citizens choose from private insurers offering government-regulated packages. The system encourages competition among insurers while ensuring universal coverage. Video by Robin Toorneman.

TA please add the h5p video with quiz in here from Robin Toorneman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QaLOiZxmUo

* USA Perspective (Steven Howard): A mix of public (Medicare, Medicaid) and private insurance, with employer-based and market-driven models dominating. The system is highly fragmented, with significant disparities in access and costs. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage, but many remain uninsured or underinsured, and high healthcare costs remain a major issue.

* UK Perspective (Ben Harris): Publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) with supplementary private healthcare options. The NHS provides universal access, but wait times and resource constraints are ongoing challenges. Private insurance is available for faster access to certain treatments, but most essential healthcare services are state-funded.

* Latin America (Fatima Delgado, Jana Schmutzler): Varies by country; a mix of public and private systems, with efforts to extend coverage to underserved populations. Brazil has a universal public system (SUS), while countries like Mexico operate hybrid models where social security institutions cover formal workers, and private insurance is used for additional coverage. In some regions, challenges in reaching rural and indigenous populations persist.

* Africa (Ellen): Predominantly public healthcare with growing private sector involvement. Many countries rely on donor funding and international aid to strengthen health infrastructure. South Africa has a two-tier system with private healthcare catering to wealthier citizens, while public services face resource constraints. Efforts are underway to implement universal health coverage in some nations.

* Australia (Jacqueline Kerhahan, Maarten Ijzerman): A hybrid model, with Medicare (public) complemented by private insurance options. Government subsidies encourage private sector participation to ease public system burdens. Private health insurance is incentivized through tax benefits, ensuring better access to specialized care.

* Canada (Ken Redekop, Ryan Pulleybank): Publicly funded universal healthcare with some private insurance for supplementary services. Each province administers its own system, with national guidelines ensuring universal access. While essential services are covered, wait times for specialist care can be long, leading some to seek private solutions.

* China (ESHPM contacts, PhD students): A mix of public and private healthcare, with ongoing reforms to improve accessibility and affordability. Public insurance schemes cover most of the population, but out-of-pocket expenses remain high for specialized care. Government efforts focus on expanding healthcare access and integrating AI-driven solutions into medical practice.

**Surfing the waves in healthcare STPSS: human-centered care and value-Based Healthcare as catalysts for innovation**

**Value-based healthcare**

Value-based healthcare started with the seminal work of Porter (2010), with key principles to improve care: 
* Patient-Centered Care: VBHC emphasizes treating patients as active participants in their own care, focusing on their specific needs and outcomes.
* Outcome Measurement: Regular measurement and analysis of health outcomes are critical, ensuring that care interventions are effective.
* Cost-Effectiveness: VBHC seeks to achieve the best possible outcomes at the lowest possible cost, often involving cost management and efficiency improvements.

Even though it is a convincing framework, it is not as easy as it seems to implement. Yet, it can be an important catalyst for innovation and influence how you can harness this trend in your innovations.The concept of value-based healthcare is central to modern MedTech innovation. The "Implementing Value-Based Healthcare in Europe: Handbook for Pioneers" offers practical guidance on creating value within health systems. This approach focuses on improving patient outcomes while optimizing costs. Access the handbook here.

**Can value-based healthcare be a catalyst for innovation?**

 Many organizations have struggled for decades to find the right balance to provide the best value for money. In this session, we discuss key difficulties about the implementation of value-based healthcare based on the article by Reindersma et al. (2024) and Van Elten (2023).

Case Study: The Santeon Hospitals
The Santeon Hospitals in the Netherlands provide a practical example of VBHC in action. By collaborating across a network, these hospitals have implemented VBHC principles to enhance care quality and efficiency. Key elements include:

* Collaborative Learning: Santeon hospitals share data and best practices to continuously improve patient outcomes.
* Standardized Outcome Measures: They utilize standardized measures to track performance and identify areas for improvement.
* Patient Involvement: Patients are engaged in their care processes, providing feedback that informs quality improvement initiatives.

However, there are challenges and critiques of VBHC. Implementing standardized outcome measures can be difficult due to variations in patient populations and conditions. Additionally, focusing on cost-effectiveness might sometimes lead to under-provision of necessary but expensive treatments.

**Can patient-centered care be a catalyst for innovation?**

Personalized healthcare and precision medicine are related trends to value-based healthcare that may be useful to support innovations. By tailoring treatments to individual patients, personalized healthcare can potentially improve outcomes and efficiency, key goals of VBHC. It involves tailoring medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. These approaches diviate from standard care as it were as they become more individually tailored interventions. Personalized healthcare aims to move away from standardized healthcare with a "one-size-fits-all" model and towards treatments that consider individual variability (Collins & Varmus, 2015). These interventions use genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors to design more effective and personalized care plans.

Key aspects here are patient-related outcome measures (PROMS) and PREMS. Can you identify the innovations that are used to make the patient-centered a reality in a Danish hospital?

These trends are advanced through technological developments in the field of biotech. For example the use of complex multiplex cell cultures, which allows for more precise modeling of human diseases and testing of treatments. These cultures can replicate the interactions between different cell types within the body, providing a more accurate representation of how diseases progress and how treatments work in a real human environment (Pampaloni et al., 2007).

Another example is organ-on-a-chip technology. How do you think this could change the biomedical innovation pathway?

Introduction

Innovation pathways in healthcare play a critical role in determining how new medical technologies, treatments, and interventions move from concept to implementation. Understanding these pathways allows innovators to design effective strategies, anticipate challenges, and optimize the development process. This chapter explores the relevance of innovation pathways, outlines the traditional biomedical innovation model, highlights the need for improvements in digital health and service-based innovations, and introduces key theories such as the IDER model and front-loading theory to enhance innovation strategies.

The Traditional Biomedical Innovation Pathway

The dominant biomedical innovation pathway follows a structured, often linear, process that includes fundamental research, preclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, and market introduction. This pathway has been well-established for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, ensuring safety, efficacy, and compliance with strict regulatory standards. Key steps in this process can be seen in the USA health system described with Figure 1 of this JAMA article https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820562.

```{figure} ./figures/stages_drug_dev-JAMA.png
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(6):e2415445. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.15445, Legend: Stages of Drug Development, BLA indicates Biologic License Application; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; IND, Investigational New Drug; NDA, New Drug Application.
```

While this pathway has proven effective for traditional medical products, it does not always accommodate the complexities of emerging innovations such as software-driven interventions (e.g., digital therapeutics like Germany's DiGA framework) or theranostics (e.g., diabetes management integrating biomarkers and digital drug delivery). These new categories demand more flexible, iterative innovation models. Ijzerman, Koffijberg, Fenwick, and Krahn (2017) emphasize the importance of early health technology assessment in medical product development, highlighting the need for more adaptive frameworks (PharmacoEconomics, 35(7), 727–740).

**Beyond Pharma and Medtech: The Need for Improved Pathways**

More Complex Product-Service Combinations

Innovation in healthcare now extends beyond pharmaceuticals and medical devices to include complex, service-oriented digital health solutions. Digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics, and virtual interventions using extended reality (XR) require pathways that account for evolving regulatory frameworks, interdisciplinary integration, and shifting healthcare dynamics. The traditional model must adapt to support parallel innovation processes that accommodate both technological and socio-economic considerations. Therefore, we need to rethink healthcare innovation models to effectively integrate these complex product-service combinations into routine care.

The Need for New Innovation Theories to Revise This Framework

A stronger theoretical foundation is required to improve innovation processes, especially in terms of translating ideas into care practices. Healthcare innovators must ultimately be able to reshape systems to support the adoption and sustainability of novel solutions. This also applies to the traditional biomedical innovation pathway, whereby the alst part market launch is in reality a black box. Few people really knows, what it takes for a drug to be fully become available to the market of a country. 

Have a look at this video by dr. Frederick Thielen about key issues that are happening in practice to get to a succesfull launch. What things should you consider upfront in this innovation pathway?

[![3 Things About Market Access](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8NhuaohK_Qg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NhuaohK_Qg)


Compton-Phillips (2024) emphasizes the importance of care delivery innovation in achieving this transformation. Underneath we will explore a few key theoreties one can use to help understand key dynamics in innovation pathways.  Ultimately it requires integrating service design principles, systems thinking, early health technology assessment, and implementation science. Ultimators can than develop frameworks that better support their healthcare innovations beyond traditional pharmaceutical and medtech pathway.

**The IDER Model: Parallel Processes in Innovation**

The IDER model—Initiation, Design, Engineering, and Realization—proposed by Smulders (2022), challenges the notion of linear innovation pathways. Instead, it presents innovation as a set of interconnected, parallel processes that evolve dynamically. This approach acknowledges that various aspects of innovation (e.g., technological development, regulatory considerations, and market readiness) progress simultaneously rather than sequentially. Understanding this non-linear structure helps innovators navigate complex innovation ecosystems effectively.

**Front-Loading Theory and Its Relevance**

Front-loading theory emphasizes the importance of identifying key challenges early in the innovation process. Mapping potential bottlenecks—such as regulatory hurdles, sustainability concerns, workforce integration, and ethical considerations—at the outset allows for proactive problem-solving. Dolfsma, Eijk, and Mahdi (2022) highlight that investing effort and resources early can mitigate risks and improve overall success rates in medical technology innovation.

Implementing Front-Loading Theory

Front-loading can be operationalized through several strategies:

* Strategic Problem-Solution Co-Evolution – Innovators should iteratively refine both the problem definition and the solution approach in response to emerging insights.

* Circular Pathway Design Thinking – Incorporating continuous feedback loops ensures that innovation pathways remain adaptive and responsive to real-world needs.

* Parallel Process Integration (IDER Model) – Balancing multiple development streams prevents bottlenecks and accelerates time-to-market.

* Ethical and Societal Considerations – Incorporating ethical principles early, as discussed by Jeroen van den Hoven and Stefan Buijsman, ensures that innovations align with societal values and long-term sustainability (see WHO report on AI ethics: WHO AI Ethics Report and OpenWHO course: Ethics and AI).

**Herzlinger's Three Strategies for Operationalizing Front-Loading**

Regina Herzlinger (2024) identifies three primary strategies to support front-loading in healthcare innovation:

* Internal Development – Leveraging in-house expertise and infrastructure to refine innovation early.

* Growth Driver Strategy – Partnering with healthcare institutions and regulatory bodies to ensure alignment with market and policy requirements.

* External Collaboration – Engaging external stakeholders, such as academic institutions and technology firms, to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and capabilities.

**Conclusion**

Innovation pathways in healthcare are evolving to accommodate new technological and service-driven advancements. Traditional biomedical models provide a foundation but must be expanded to support parallel processes, digital solutions, and ethical considerations. By applying the IDER model, front-loading theory, and Herzlinger’s strategic approaches, innovators can navigate complex pathways more effectively, leading to more successful and impactful healthcare solutions.

 front-loading theory to explain that you must map key steps in the innovation pathway and start with those that you consider to be problematic in the future e.g. Front-loading future needs, sustainability concerns, work-staff concerns, 

There are standard innovation pathways for drugs and medical devices but a large array of innovaitons does not have an innovation pathway set out: e.g. sofware-driven interventions, called digital therapeutics (See Germany DIGA), or theranostics (See the area of diabetes, see review article) based on technological advancements in biomarkers (nanomedicine) and digital delivery of the drugs or interventions (also virtual with XR applications)

Apply exercise: try 

Overarching innovation theory to keep in mind is the C-K theory, design theory which helps to explain that you need to move with a group of people from the well known knowledge to the conceptual space to develop a new idea.

### Chosing a scope and aim will determine the innovation pathway: 
optimalisation, develop new care pathway, revise socio-technological product service system, this will impact feasibility and scope for scalability: and strategy for implementation (Health technology assessment has strict requirements)

* start of the innovation can be at fundamental research but also at a later stage

* problem-solution co-evolution theory
* circular pathways design thinking
* Frido theory; IDER in paralel processes

* Hertzlinger: look for strategic partnerships in the health system: Middle growht strategy

```

```{tip}
TA Change to exercise format: For example a foundation developed a succesful serious game in the USA called Re-mission 2 you could try to leverage that game with new technologies to improve wellbeing in personalized XR environments. This would be an innovation pathway bringin exisitng innovations together and working towards a market access strategy that may involve a reimbursement strategy https://hopelab.org/case-study/re-mission/. Re-mission 2 showed benefits in terms of improved adherence to treatment and indicators of cancer-rleated self-efficacy and knowledge in young people with cancer, and it seems that they did not apply for FDA approval. A potential strategy could be to use a middle-growth strategy and work with pharmaceutical companies to leverage support for market access in conjunction with an existing or new treatment.

## Preparing the organization
```{note}
Learning goal: be able to apply a strategy for your starting point with strategic advantage
```
* Find your purpose driven mission start in line with the organization: Topic of innovation: Developing a strategic starting point: Megatrends and strategies of the organization (Valeu-based healthcare, cost-efficiency, prodider driven)

explain your mission to different people in the organizations with different communication strategies

* Synergize behaviors within the existing organzation: 
Healthcare organizations are hierarchical administrative organizations with many individual entrepreneurs, who are conditioned to innovate in very specific spaces controlled by laws and medical guidelines

Healthcare organizations are not used to radical innovative behaviour

Alignment with leadership at different levels in the organization

## Integrating innovation behavior
```{note}
Learning goal: be able to apply a strategy to embed your innovation process
```
* key innovating behaviors in steps: problem, solution prototyping, validation, but in practice more complex with co-evolution cycles

develop strategy to change mindset from solution driven to problem driven

* structure to support processes needs to be adapted to organization, difficult to find time, finding the right people at the right time is important who are interested in spending extra time in innovation


### Stakeholder assembly procedure

* select stakeholders

C-K process flow from unknown to known
Theoretical criteria, knowledge types and inference types

* assemble diverse stakeholder team 

It is important to recruit people with the appropriate expertise. 

You could look for people coming from patient driven trainings like:
* the Patient Innovation Bootcamp or from Mens Achter de Patient Academy (Patient as a Person Foundation) in The Netherlands https://mensachterdepatient.nl/english/default.aspx 
* Relevant patient umbrella organizations who have an interest in collaboraive design innovation: e.g. for young adults with cancer https://ayazorgnetwerk.nl/
* Organizations which focus on getting patients more engaged in the care profess: Patient in Regie (Patient Engagement)


```{admonition} Be careful!
:class: note 
Include relevant stakeholders early on
```

### Setting up a team and managing collaborative projects

Try to get everyone on board in a team, develop a team name, assign roles and tasks

You can use free software tools to work collaboratively like Google Docs, Notion for tasks or Miro for creative making and prototyping

### Generative co-design sessions + business development tools to guide strategic decisions regarding revenue streams, the behaviors are integrated in these sessions

Explain process and explain how creative tools work and mindfulness and vision exercises

#### Explore

* Mission driven start

It is essential that you build a mission and vision and try to clarify what the general aim would be. 

It could be a great benefit if you have someone related to your initiative who has been feeling the pain firsthand and wants to make a change.

clinical problem validation, understanding care pathways and patient journeys

When looking at your diagnosis as a patient decades after the diagnosis happened it is interesting how profound the emotions are and how traumatic the impact can be, even if the cancer is cured.

Here is a video of the comedian Tom Green who shared his experience shortly after diagnosis:

Advanced level:
Try to gather input about the patient journey in a very detailed manner to work out a patient-level cost analysis of the pathway to quantify the paintpoint even better.
For example, see this paper mapping subfertility pathways by dr. Maura Leusder: Patient-level cost analysis of subfertility pathways in the Dutch healthcare system  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-024-01744-5



#### Create: prototyping technology and engineering

need for research approach with hypothesise to validate assumptions with prototype

Validation prototype types: functional, aesthaethic, cost impact

starting simple validation to more complex validation
1. early in practice validation

Try a feasibility like this Virtual reality application combined with neurofeedback (see Rolbiecki, A. J., Craig, K., Polniak, M., Smith, J., Ghosh, P., & Mehr, D. R. (2023). Virtual reality and neurofeedback for Management of Cancer Symptoms: a feasibility pilot. American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine®, 40(3), 291-298.)


2. early HTA And evidence gathering for prototyping evalutation strategy and clinical evalutation strategy

```{tip}
Look for creative places in your organization, like the Create4Care lab at Erasmus MC or Rotterdam Square validation processes, you can use to validate clinical aspects of your innovation
```

#### Resource management strategies (funding and investors)

Try to understand what kind of money you need to survive and how the financial revenue streams look like. 

Map out the different revenue streams on different levels, care organization, wider network of organizations on a regional and national level: e.g. does the ward have an innovation budget? The hospital? the health insurer? the government?


```{tip}
Start assessing and modelling how your innovation can reduce costs, many hospitals are looking to be more efficient within the given budget by the health insurer, look at the case of a circular healthcare initiative that made the business case by showing how they reduced costs to the hospital by reusing medical waste material here on page 91 in the open textbook 'Creating a circular healthcare ecnomomy' : https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/1507

##### Financial strategies

Using your resources wisely is important, especially in the beginning as you could invest in developing your idea with more research, building a functional prototype or running a feasibility test. It could be used to build a minimum viable product.

There are different type of funding you can look for:
* pre-seed funding
* larger grants
* crowdfunding strategies
* Venture capital investments

Strategically it is important to look for organizations that can provide financial support in different ways and who understand your mission about value-based healthcare:

```{tip}
When pitching your idea to investors, irrespective of the level, it is important to use the right terminology and show the right numbers. It is a good practice to start from the TAM SAM SOM calculations to show the market size. check out these videos here https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-innovation-entrepreneurship

#### From wide vision for the unique value proposition to focus on a beachhead market strategy

After you have the wide vision try to bring focus on the first entry point of your value proposition where the interests of all stakeholders align. For instance, you may have developed a fantastic scalable idea, but now you need to look into how to make it very small and actionable to focus all your efforts to get a first cashflow: a beachead market strategy


Look at megatrends and priorities in the health system you want to have a first impact in: see report Poli-technico Milano

see Gartner videos
