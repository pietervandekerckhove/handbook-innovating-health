# Preface

* Aim: This handbook is aimed at care professionals, patients, care organization managers (hospitals, health insurers) people working in startups, people working in health innovation in government or academia or anyone interested and motivated to make an impact with their innovative drive in the health system. This book should empower these people to make a change.
  
* Who should read it and why?

If the next pandemic would break out tomorrow what would you do? We have seen unprecendted formidable actions from people innovating and being entrepreneurial to combat the Covid-19 crisis on all levels in an integrated way. (See the EURAM Symposium conference https://conferences.euram.academy/2025conference/symposia/#toggle-id-6)

If there is a problem and a unified societal mission to solve hat problem different stakeholders from withing the care system unite their resources to develop a new solution.

1. During Covid-19 there was a unified mission to develop
    1. temperature measurement solutions
    2. sanitizing alcohol solutions
    3. masks solutions
    3. vaccination centres
    4. fast-lab analysis
    5. fast vaccination developmant, regulatory approval and market access and logistics for manufacturing

Somehow these integrated innovation pathways and practices dissolved. However, there are combined efforts, however not on that scale. For example:
    
1. To develop a human-centered experience: solutions are built to inform patiens through health data, problems with electronic medical records, show however there is no concert as it serves only one stakeholder

2. To improve logisitc, reduce staff there are drone solutiosn to move blood and medical emergency devices, that require a harmony of legislation, technology, operations, infrastructre and care paths.

People continue to learn about innovation (Management and business) and how innovation works (engineering), and how it should be shaped (design), but not actually to innovate in the trenches in healthcare, we hope this handbook can help people to innovate more effectively. There is a need for new Delta sciences (Frido)

We start from the healthcare practice where theory and practice are integrated. This handbook is therefore structured for practitioners with the scientific background in each thoses sections accordingly.

Many people who read this may realise they are already entrepreurial and it is important to note that everyone can innovate and be entrepreneurial in the health system, in fact it is urgently needed!

There are global criseses in the health system in terms of staffing, planetary health and health outcomes.

We hope this can synergize interest from people from differnet backgrounds tackles these global problems.
