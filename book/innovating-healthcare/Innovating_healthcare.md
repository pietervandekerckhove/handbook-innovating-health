## Outline

test test test

## Preface
* Aim: This handbook is aimed at care professionals, patients, care organization managers (hospitals, health insurers) people working in startups, people working in health innovation in government or academia or anyone interested and motivated to make an impact with their innovative drive in the health system. This book should empower these people to make a change.
  
* Who should read it and why?

(INSERT H5P quiz here with suggestion to read the book, but need to extrac the data on the back-end)

If the next pandemic would break out tomorrow what would you do? We have seen unprecendted formidable actions from people innovating and being entrepreneurial to combat the Covid-19 crisis on all levels in an integrated way. (See the EURAM Symposium conference https://conferences.euram.academy/2025conference/symposia/#toggle-id-6)


If there is a problem and a unified societal mission to solve hat problem different stakeholders from withing the care system unite their resources to develop a new solution.

1. During Covid-19 there was a unified mission to develop
    1. temperature measurement solutions
    2. sanitizing alcohol solutions
    3. masks solutions
    3. vaccination centres
    4. fast-lab analysis
    5. fast vaccination developmant, regulatory approval and market access and logistics for manufacturing

Somehow these integrated innovation pathways and practices dissolved. However, there are combined efforts, however not on that scale. For example:
    
1. To develop a human-centered experience: solutions are built to inform patiens through health data, problems with electronic medical records, show however there is no concert as it serves only one stakeholder

2. To improve logisitc, reduce staff there are drone solutiosn to move blood and medical emergency devices, that require a harmony of legislation, technology, operations, infrastructre and care paths.

Peopel continue to learn about innovation (Management and business) and how innovation works (engineering), and how it should be shaped (design), but not actually to innovate in the trenches in healthcare, we hope this handbook can help people to innovate more effectively. There is a need for new Delta sciences (Frido)

We start from the healthcare practice where theory and practice are integrated. This handbook is therefore structured for practitioners with the scientific background in each thoses sections accordingly.

Many people who read this may realise they are already entrepreurial and it is important to note that everyone can innovate and be entrepreneurial in the health system, in fact it is urgently needed!

There are global criseses in the health system in terms of staffing, planetary health and health outcomes.

 We hope this can synergize interest from people from differnet backgrounds tackles these global problems.

## Introduction
This is a handbook made for practitioners to innovate from within the organization. 

* Explain structure of the guide


## 1. What is innovating and entrepreneuring in health organizations (hospitals)?
```{note}
Learning goal: understand that innovation in healthcare organizations requires a strategic entrepreneurial approach
```
* many innovations are just lying there without an entrepreneurial strategy behind them so there is no long term impact

* Overlap scientific behaviour and entrepreneurial behaviour relevant in health system driven by scientific insights

* transdisicplenary approach from management and strategy, organizational sciences, health sciences, health economics, technology sciences, patient expertise, law and regulations, ethics, Human-centered and strategic design, entrepreneurship

* per defintion this behaviour spans beyond one oragnisation and accross innovation processes
1. from fundamental research organizations (Universities) to clinical pracitce


## 1. Innovating in socio-technical product service systems in healthcare on different levels
```{note}
Learning goal: understand how differences between socio-technical product service systems on different levels impact health innovation
```
* What are socio-technical produt service systems

1. definition
1. different actors (stakeholers and evolving technology)
1. Interaction technology people (example electronic medical records)
2. Social determinants (Ramirez Promiting Health equity figure 2008), see also WHO Open course https://openwho.org/courses/sdh-concepts

* European perspective (Bettina Maisch, Ines), national insurances, Medical Device regulation, AI act
* USA perspective (Steven Howard), different payment models
* UK Perspective (Ben Harris), combination public and private
* Latin America (Fatima Delgado, Jana Schmutzler): caring for indegenous populations
* Africa (Ellen)
* Australia (Jacqueline Kerhahan, Maarten Ijzerman)
* Canada (Ken Redekop)
* China (ESHPM contacts, PhD students)

Example I believe we need to work toward sustainable healthcare and healing environment, through whichp people can practice a healing mindfulness experience

Meditation and mindfullness can be used in healing practice

## Create you own innovation pathway
```{note}
Learning goal: understand how differences between innovation pathways impact innovation strategies
```
### Innovating scope and layers of complexicity: 
optimalisation, develop new care pathway, revise socio-technological product service system, this will impact feasibility and scope for scalability: and strategy for implementation (Health technology assessment has strict requirements)

* start of the innovation can be at fundamental research but also at a later stage

* problem-solution co-evolution theory
* circular pathways design thinking
* Frido theory; IDER in paralel processes

* Hertzlinger: look for strategic partnerships in the health system: Middle growht strategy

* front-loading theory to explain that you must map key steps in the innovation pathway and start with those

Front-loading future needs, sustainability concerns, work-staff concerns, 

consider incoporating ethical values in the design of the problem-solution early, e.g. regarding research ethics, but also regarding the use of AI see this book https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240029200 or this free online course https://openwho.org/courses/ethics-ai




* draft your innovation pathway

case from Dutch AYA network (see latest article from Carla, Sophia and I): innovation through national support organizations

case AYA family room UZA: process self-funded, patient-driven innovation


## Preparing the organization
```{note}
Learning goal: be able to apply a strategy for your starting point with strategic advantage
```
* Find your purpose driven mission start in line with the organization: Topic of innovation: Developing a strategic starting point: Megatrends and strategies of the organization (Valeu-based healthcare, cost-efficiency, prodider driven)

explain your mission to different people in the organizations with different communication strategies

* Synergize behaviors within the existing organzation: 
Healthcare organizations are hierarchical administrative organizations with many individual entrepreneurs, who are conditioned to innovate in very specific spaces controlled by laws and medical guidelines

Healthcare orgnizations are not used to radical innovative behaviour

Alignment with leadership at different levels in the organization

### Communication and pitching your idea to different people in the organization

Different people in the organization will have different incentives to focus on innovation and changes next to their core activities. That is why it is crucial to use those 20 seconds or 1 minute ot your maximum advantage. Try to come across in a professional way. Try to practice your pitch with people or sign up with the Toastmasters platform https://www.toastmasters.org/ and join a club and you can even gain free access to an AI tool Yoodli that analyzes your pitch: https://www.toastmasters.org/myhome/welcome-to-yoodli

## Integrating innovation behavior
```{note}
Learning goal: be able to apply a strategy to embed your innovation process
```
* key innovating behaviors in steps: problem, solution prototyping, validation, but in practice more complex with co-evolution cycles

develop strategy to change mindset from solution driven to problem driven

* structure to support processes needs to be adapted to organization, difficult to find time, finding the right people at the right time is important who are interested in spending extra time in innovation

### Stakeholder asssembly procedure

* select stakeholders

C-K process flow from unknown to known
Theoretical criteria, knowledge types and inference types

* assemble diverse stakeholder team 

### Generative co-design sessions + business development tools to guide strategic decisions regarding revenue streams, the behaviors are integrated in these sessions

Explain process and explain how creative tools work and mindfulness and vision exercises

#### Explore

* Mission driven start

Feeling the pain firsthand and wanting to make a change

clinical problem validation, understanding care pathways and patient journeys

market problem validation

#### Create: prototyping technology and engineering

need for research approach with hypothesise to validate assumptions with prototype

Validation prototype types: functional, aesthaethic, cost impact

starting simple validation to more complex validation
1. early in practice validation
2. early HTA And evidence gathering for prototyping evalutation strategy and clinical evalutation strategy

```{tip}
Look for creative places in your organization, like the Create4Care lab at Erasmus MC or Rotterdam Square validation processes, you can use to validate clinical aspects of your innovation
```

#### Financial strategies (funding and investors)

Map out the different revenue streams on different levels, care organization, wider network of organizations on a regional and national level: e.g. does the ward have an innovation budget? The hospital? the health insurer? the government?


```{tip}
Start assessing and modelling how your innovation can reduce costs, many hospitals are looking to be more efficient within the given budget by the health insurer, look at the case of a circular healthcare initiative that made the business case by showing how they reduced costs to the hospital by reusing medical waste material here on page 91 in the open textbook 'Creating a circular healthcare ecnomomy' : https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/1507
```

#### From wide vision for the unique value proposition to focus on a beachhead market strategy

After you have the wide vision try to bring focus on the first entry point of your value proposition where the interests of all stakeholders align. For instance, you may have developed a fantastic scalable idea, but now you need to look into how to make it very small and actionable to focus all your efforts to get a first cashflow: a beachead market strategy


Look at megatrends and priorities in the health system you want to have a first impact in: see report Poli-technico Milano

see Gartner videos
