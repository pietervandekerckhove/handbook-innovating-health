## Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of health organizations, innovation and entrepreneurship at the individual level are crucial for driving progress and fostering continuous improvement. This chapter explores how individuals can harness their creativity, skills, and passion to make a meaningful impact in healthcare.

Innovation involves identifying opportunities for improvement, developing novel solutions, and implementing changes that enhance care quality and operational efficiency. Entrepreneurship requires taking initiative, assuming risks, and driving projects that create value for patients, providers, and the organization. Successful healthcare entrepreneurship demands collaboration among diverse sectors, learning through experience, coping with ambiguity and risk, and meticulous planning.

As you progress through this chapter, you will learn how to develop a strategy to innovate on an individual level in healthcare organizations. Focus on key entrepreneurial behaviors:

Collaborate and lead change: Work closely with diverse sectors to achieve common goals.
* Learn through experience: Set up evidence strategies for clinical trials.
* Cope with ambiguity and risk: Navigate project uncertainty and the inherent risks of healthcare.
* Plan upfront: Understand the long timelines and risks in healthcare entrepreneurship.
* Take initiative: Collaborate with stakeholders to align priorities and tackle relevant problems.

Additionally, you will learn about the strategic alignment of these behaviors with the incentives of various stakeholders in the health system. This understanding is crucial for ensuring that your innovative efforts are supported and sustained within the complex healthcare environment.

This chapter is highly relevant for your team project assignment. Use the insights gained to develop a strategic vision and assemble a powerful team. 

## Defining Innovation

## Develop key steps for integration
Different stakeholders in the health system can be entrepreneurial and many of them already show entrepreneurial behavior. On an individual level care professionals are constantly collaborating to improve the health of people and they are doing that in an entrepreneurial way.

Fundamentally it is about the mindset of people looking for the problem of people (in a preventive or curative setting) and wanting to do something about that. This is a very fuzzy concept to define, but you can notice when care professionals are going beyond their comfort zone to look for the best treatment there is for patients they are connecting ideas, people and the organization and move that to a new context, which changes and incorporates that change. 

More abstractly, in line with the Entrecomp framework ([European Commission Joint Research Centre, n.d.](#entrecomp)):

```{figure} ../figures/entrecomp.png

:name: figure-example

Entrecomp areas and learning progress (European Commission)
```

Specifying these Entrecomp (into action behaviors) in a health setting, they can be specified as follows:
* Skills to collaborate and facilitate or lead a change in an existing setting: this is essential in healthcare across very diverse sectors people will need to collaborate very closely
* Learning through experience: this is not just learning through simple tests, but often one needs to learn how to set up an evidence stategy to develop clinical trials
* Coping with ambiguity and risk: this is a double-faced challenge as the project itself is uncertain from an entrepreneurial perspective, but also the healthcare organization is an environment where the health and sometimes even the lives are at stake of people, so it is also a very risky environment to operate in.
* Planning upfront is essential and more important than in other fields, in healthcare entrepreneurship it can take many years before you actually are able to offer your solution to the end-user, like patients. This is a significant risk for your reveneu streams. That is why in healthcare entrepreneurship one could argue there are two valleys of death. One long period before your product is commercially viable, safe and effective. Another long period my pass before you gain access to the markets of health systems in particular countries. In total for new pharmaceutical products it can take up to 20 years.
* Taking the initiative in healthcare entrepreneurship by itself is not enough. There are many people in healthcare organizations like hospitals, but also from the government and in the industry who are putting enormous efforts in trying to implement new solutions to improve the health system. In healthcare entrepreneurship this requires a unique collaboration between different payers and users to align priorities in the first place, otherwise the problem you are tackling may never be perceived as being a priority in that health system at that time.

The mindset and the specific behaviours can manifest differently across the general innovation process depending on the phase and the aim:
* In the beginning abstract on a mindset level
* More focused to develop a product-service solution
* More focused to integrate it in the existing STPSS

Therefore it becomes key to learn how to use these behaviors in the innovation process steps to make an impact with an idea to improve the care process.

## Defining Healthcare Technology (STEVE ADD MACRO POLICY AND MARKET TRENDS)

According to the WHO's "Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025", digital health, leverages technology to enhance healthcare delivery systems globally. This includes wearable health monitors, diagnostic imaging systems, robotic surgery, and digital health applications ([World Health Organization, 2020](#who2020)). This includes a broad range of product-service systems. For example: devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures, and systems developed to solve health problems and improve quality of life. These technologies facilitate the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases. Healthcare technology integrates advancements from various fields, including biotechnology, information technology, and medical devices, to enhance patient outcomes and streamline healthcare operations.

**Strategic alignment of stakeholder incentives upfront**

Healthcare innovation is notoriously challenging due to multiple structural, regulatory, and behavioral barriers. As outlined by [Herzlinger (2006)](#herzlinger) in "Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard", several factors contribute to this difficulty. 

Please read the article: "Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard": In this seminal article, Herzlinger identifies several systemic barriers that make healthcare innovation particularly difficult. She argues that the complexity of healthcare systems, coupled with regulatory constraints, misaligned incentives, and risk-averse stakeholders, creates a challenging environment for new innovations to thrive. The article highlights key factors contributing to these difficulties, such as fragmented healthcare markets, resistance to disruptive change, and the challenge of balancing scientific rigor with market-driven entrepreneurial strategies. Herzlinger emphasizes the need for strategic alignment between policymakers, investors, and healthcare providers to foster an ecosystem conducive to sustainable innovation.

```{admonition} Important
Therefore the question rises: How to align incentives, deal with risk-averse stakeholders upfront? In a health system many stakeholders have a misalignment between the financial incentives and the need to innovate targeting patient outcoems of interest. For example, when you are innovating to improve the wellbeing of patients, you cannot do that in the standard health system, because there is no reimbursement or incentive to innovate interventions going beyond the biomedical interventions of patient outcomes. Finding a sustainable business model in this area is an important challenge for all digital wellbeing tools.

**Key aspects to take into account**:
* Lack of Entrepreneurial Strategy: Many promising innovations fail to achieve long-term impact due to the absence of a strategic entrepreneurial approach. Without a clear business model, funding strategy, and implementation plan, innovations remain underutilized.

* Scientific vs. Entrepreneurial Behavior: The healthcare system is predominantly driven by scientific discoveries, which often lack integration with entrepreneurial mindsets necessary for commercialization and widespread adoption.

* Transdisciplinary Complexity: Innovation in healthcare requires expertise spanning multiple disciplines, including:

        Philosophy
        
        Management and strategy

        Organizational sciences

        Health sciences and economics

        Technology sciences

        Patient expertise

        Law and regulations

        Psychology

        Creativity

        Ethics

        Human-centered and strategic design

        Entrepreneurship

* Beyond Organizational Boundaries: Healthcare innovation inherently spans across organizations and multiple stages of the innovation process. It involves collaboration between fundamental research institutions (e.g., universities) and clinical practice, necessitating coordinated efforts for successful implementation.


By adopting a strategic entrepreneurial approach, healthcare organizations can overcome these challenges and drive impactful innovations. This requires fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, developing clear implementation pathways, and aligning technological advancements with patient-centered needs and market viability.
