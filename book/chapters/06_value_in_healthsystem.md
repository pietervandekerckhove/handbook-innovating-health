## Introduction
Welcome to this chapter on understanding how differences between socio-technical product service systems at various levels impact the health innovation pathway. In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, it is crucial to recognize the interplay between technology, services, and societal factors. This chapter aims to equip you with the knowledge to navigate these complexities and drive meaningful innovations in health.

Throughout this chapter, you will explore the nuances of socio-technical systems and their influence on health innovation. We will delve into case studies, theoretical frameworks, and practical examples to illustrate these concepts. Additionally, you will have access to engaging videos and quizzes designed to reinforce your learning and provide a deeper understanding of the material.

By the end of this chapter, you will be prepared to apply your newfound knowledge in a team project assignment. This collaborative exercise will challenge you to analyze real-world scenarios, propose innovative solutions, and demonstrate your ability to integrate socio-technical perspectives into health innovation pathways.

## Innovating with technology, organizations and people (TOP): Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS):

Socio-technical systems theory, as initially developed by Trist (1981), emphasizes the mutual shaping of social and technical elements within an organization. This approach is particularly pertinent to healthcare, where the interaction between human actors (e.g., healthcare providers, patients) and technical components (e.g., medical devices, health information systems) is complex and dynamic. Appelbaum (1997) further elaborates on the application of STS theory in organizational development, highlighting how it can drive innovation and improvement in healthcare settings.

A working definition of innovation by prof. Frido Smulders is:

```{admonition} Definition
"Innovation is introducing smoething new, into an existing context. This context, to accept the innovation, will undergo some changes."
```

**Generally, there are three key actors: people, technology and organizations:**

````{admonition} Prof. Frido Smulders explains the relevance of people, technology and organizations in the innovation pathway. What went wrong in the example of the aircraft?

Venturing into systems where value is created for users through different stakeholders and multiple interrelated services and products, such as in healthcare, public services, hospitality, and aerospace, is challenging. These systems are known as Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS). To operationalize this term in today's context where technology assumes many complex forms, we have added the product-service systems specification. This helps describe the complex environments in which todayâ€™s entrepreneurs operate. 

In STPSS, each stakeholder can create value in the health system. The value is created through the interaction of these stakeholders in a social process.

```
````

Each stakeholder possesses explicable knowledge about their role and the system's functionality. Explicable knowledge, defined as implicit knowledge that can be made explicit during social interaction (Smulders, Lousberg & Dorst, 2008), forms a chain where products and services are interrelated. According to sociotechnical systems theory (Trist, 1981; Appelbaum, 1997), STPSS involves several individuals who shape a piece of technology or a product, or both, assigned to them within their own workplaces, creating an integrated chain of product-service value deliveries at the system level.

Entrepreneurs face significant challenges in developing an integrated new venture idea (NVI) that spans the entire value chain within an STPSS. Integrating the explicable knowledge of diverse stakeholders into an NVI is crucial, yet there has been little emphasis on the social process of knowledge interaction in NVI development.



## The health value you create: interaction between social determinants, digital determinants, stakeholders and evolving technology

Regarding our health, a STPSS is complex as there is an interaction with society, our digital environment, the organizations and technologies we are exposed to and which we use. Therefore, there is a complex interaction between people and health technology (e.g., electronic medical records). Understanding the healthcare STPSS, its actors, and their interdependencies is crucial. 

These interactions can be visualized by the social determinants. Some key factors influencing our health for instance are education, income and age (Dahlgren, G., & Whitehead, M. (2021). The Dahlgren-Whitehead model of health determinants: 30 years on and still chasing rainbows. Public health, 199, 20-24.).

Main determinants of health (Dahlgren, G., & Whitehead, M. (2021). The Dahlgren-Whitehead model of health determinants: 30 years on and still chasing rainbows. Public health, 199, 20-24.)
```


To explain how these social determinants influence people's health, you can have a look at the figure below explaining how social determinants influence cardiovascular disease, a disease which has one of the highest impacts globally.

```{figure} ../figures/Hypertension-social-determinants-and-CVD.jpg
:name: figure-example

Conceptual framework on the digital determinants of health. Socioecological and life course approaches of social determinants of health leading to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Social determinants of health (SDOHs) encompass socioeconomic, political, and environmental contexts, including neighborhood poverty and poor housing conditions, social policies and built environment, public health policies and legislation, climate change and pollution, and crisis events. These SDOHs contribute to an increased risk of premature CVD and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) through health care system and psychosocial stress pathway, such as sympathetic-adreno-medullar and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. BP indicates blood pressure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CRP, C-reactive protein; and UPF, ultra-processed food. (Chaturvedi, A., Zhu, A., Gadela, N. V., Prabhakaran, D., & Jafar, T. H. (2024). Social determinants of health and disparities in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension, 81(3), 387-399.)
```

To get a good grasp on the impact of our societies on our health take a look at the TED talk video "How not to be ignorant about the world" by Hans and Ola Rosling. 


````{admonition} Watch this TED talk from Hans and Ola Roslin 
Please follow the quiz questions actively, which are posed in the video, can you do better then the audience?

```
````

What surprised you about the societal context of people? Did you know how many years women aged 30 spent in school? How do you think that impacts women's health?



In addition, all of the problems people face with their health are increasingly being mitigated by technology, that is why recently researchers have highlighted the impact of digital determinants as well. 

```{figure} ../figures/digital-determinants.jpg
:name: figure-example

Conceptual framework on the digital determinants of health (van Kessel, R., Seghers, L. E., Anderson, M., Schutte, N. M., Monti, G., Haig, M., ... & Mossialos, E. (2024). A scoping review and expert consensus on digital determinants of health. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 103(2), 110.)
```


When innovating, it is important to take this context into account and try to map it out for the relevant innovation. The open course on Design in Healthcare: Using Patient Journey Mapping at TU Delft provides foundational knowledge about the sociotechnical context of healthcare systems. Watch the initial videos here by prof. Richard Goossens. 

TA make videos clear here: https://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/design-healthcare-using-patient-journey-mapping/?view=lectures&subject=22696

Take a look at this case of these two people. What key aspects can you identify about the context of their health journey?

## Value Creation on different levels

1. One could innovate to create value with a product in an existing system (e.g. in a hospital ward)
2. One could innovate to change the health services more broadly (e.g. in a hospital)
3. One could innovate to change the entire health system, this would typically be a disruptive innovation (e.g. a new class of treatments or a new type of remote care delivery, or theranostics)

Regarding the last level of innovation, the innovation changes the health system. Let's explore this by looking at how the system is traditionally represented: the healthcare landscape could be categorized into four key actors: patients, health care providers, regulators and third party payers. This value provision pathway could be described by looking at the relationships between these stakeholders. See this figure by Kraus: 

```{figure} ../figures/Kraus-21_Digital-transformation-traditional-Fig1.jpg
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

Stakeholders in a traditional healthcare system (Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.)
```


Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.

However, this landscape is changing. Increasingly new initiatives, like digital healthcare solutions, change the way value is created (Kraus, 2021). For instance,  a solution may not need a physical healthcare provider, the patient could self-manage, validate with an external care professional and treat a certain problem themselves. The system itself is changing as well. 

Have a look at this image from Kraus et al., which explains how digital technology reshapes the relationships in a digital health system

```{figure} ../figures/Kraus-digital-tech-health-system-potential-application.jpg
:height: 350px
:name: figure-example

Digital technology shaping the healthcare system. This figure indicates strenghts, weaknesses and threats in this transformation (Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.)
```

Further, remote healthcare solutions operate differently if the institutions are involved in a different way. For instance, new communication software or data infrastucture (5G) could allow each actor to play a different role.

Value in a socio-technical health system is created through the connection of different products and services. Over the past decades, the vision of value-based healthcare has influenced the health system, as value creation is increasingly discussed. Different methods of creating care, providing value to patients, and rewarding the value created (rather than merely the intervention) have been explored.


## Different value creation in Health Systems

Different countries have varying approaches to health insurance, coverage, and reimbursement for medical interventions. 

 Have a look at this video which describes how intentions of the implementation of new financial disease related group (DRG) structures in Germany has reduced the amount of hospitals, but not always in the right places. In addition, there is an increased focus on outpatient care, which is observed in other countries as well. Further, like many countries across the world, large investments are made in digital health.

* European Perspective (Bettina Maisch, Ines): Predominantly public, with national insurance schemes and stringent medical device regulations. Countries like Germany and France have universal health coverage with a mix of public funding and private insurance options for supplemental services. The European Union also has regulations such as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the proposed AI Act, which impact MedTech innovation.

* USA Perspective (Steven Howard): A mix of public (Medicare, Medicaid) and private insurance, with employer-based and market-driven models dominating. The system is highly fragmented, with significant disparities in access and costs. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage, but many remain uninsured or underinsured, and high healthcare costs remain a major issue.

* UK Perspective (Ben Harris): Publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) with supplementary private healthcare options. The NHS provides universal access, but wait times and resource constraints are ongoing challenges. Private insurance is available for faster access to certain treatments, but most essential healthcare services are state-funded.

* Latin America (Fatima Delgado, Jana Schmutzler): Varies by country; a mix of public and private systems, with efforts to extend coverage to underserved populations. Brazil has a universal public system (SUS), while countries like Mexico operate hybrid models where social security institutions cover formal workers, and private insurance is used for additional coverage. In some regions, challenges in reaching rural and indigenous populations persist.

* Africa (Ellen): Predominantly public healthcare with growing private sector involvement. Many countries rely on donor funding and international aid to strengthen health infrastructure. South Africa has a two-tier system with private healthcare catering to wealthier citizens, while public services face resource constraints. Efforts are underway to implement universal health coverage in some nations.

* Australia (Jacqueline Kerhahan, Maarten Ijzerman): A hybrid model, with Medicare (public) complemented by private insurance options. Government subsidies encourage private sector participation to ease public system burdens. Private health insurance is incentivized through tax benefits, ensuring better access to specialized care.

* Canada (Ken Redekop, Ryan Pulleybank): Publicly funded universal healthcare with some private insurance for supplementary services. Each province administers its own system, with national guidelines ensuring universal access. While essential services are covered, wait times for specialist care can be long, leading some to seek private solutions.

* China (ESHPM contacts, PhD students): A mix of public and private healthcare, with ongoing reforms to improve accessibility and affordability. Public insurance schemes cover most of the population, but out-of-pocket expenses remain high for specialized care. Government efforts focus on expanding healthcare access and integrating AI-driven solutions into medical practice.

**Surfing the waves in healthcare STPSS: human-centered care and value-Based Healthcare as catalysts for innovation**

**Value-based healthcare**

Value-based healthcare started with the seminal work of Porter (2010), with key principles to improve care: 
* Patient-Centered Care: VBHC emphasizes treating patients as active participants in their own care, focusing on their specific needs and outcomes.
* Outcome Measurement: Regular measurement and analysis of health outcomes are critical, ensuring that care interventions are effective.
* Cost-Effectiveness: VBHC seeks to achieve the best possible outcomes at the lowest possible cost, often involving cost management and efficiency improvements.

TA add reading exercise: Try to identify how each stakeholder has a different perspective on value-based healthcare, which are the aim and means they put forward for value-based healthcare?


Even though it is a convincing framework, it is not as easy as it seems to implement. Yet, it can be an important catalyst for innovation and influence how you can harness this trend in your innovations.The concept of value-based healthcare is central to modern MedTech innovation. The "Implementing Value-Based Healthcare in Europe: Handbook for Pioneers" offers practical guidance on creating value within health systems. This approach focuses on improving patient outcomes while optimizing costs. Access the handbook here.

**Can value-based healthcare be a catalyst for innovation?**

 Many organizations have struggled for decades to find the right balance to provide the best value for money. In this session, we discuss key difficulties about the implementation of value-based healthcare based on the article by Reindersma et al. (2024) and Van Elten (2023).

Case Study: The Santeon Hospitals
The Santeon Hospitals in the Netherlands provide a practical example of VBHC in action. By collaborating across a network, these hospitals have implemented VBHC principles to enhance care quality and efficiency. Key elements include:

* Collaborative Learning: Santeon hospitals share data and best practices to continuously improve patient outcomes.
* Standardized Outcome Measures: They utilize standardized measures to track performance and identify areas for improvement.
* Patient Involvement: Patients are engaged in their care processes, providing feedback that informs quality improvement initiatives.

However, there are challenges and critiques of VBHC. Implementing standardized outcome measures can be difficult due to variations in patient populations and conditions. Additionally, focusing on cost-effectiveness might sometimes lead to under-provision of necessary but expensive treatments.

International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement: Cambridge, MA, USA. https://www.ichom.org/resource/collaborating-for-value-the-santeon-hospitals-in-the-netherlands/

**Can patient-centered care be a catalyst for innovation?**

Personalized healthcare and precision medicine are related trends to value-based healthcare that may be useful to support innovations. By tailoring treatments to individual patients, personalized healthcare can potentially improve outcomes and efficiency, key goals of VBHC. It involves tailoring medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. These approaches diviate from standard care as it were as they become more individually tailored interventions. Personalized healthcare aims to move away from standardized healthcare with a "one-size-fits-all" model and towards treatments that consider individual variability (Collins & Varmus, 2015). These interventions use genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors to design more effective and personalized care plans.

Key aspects here are patient-related outcome measures (PROMS) and PREMS. Can you identify the innovations that are used to make the patient-centered a reality in a Danish hospital?

These trends are advanced through technological developments in the field of biotech. For example the use of complex multiplex cell cultures, which allows for more precise modeling of human diseases and testing of treatments. These cultures can replicate the interactions between different cell types within the body, providing a more accurate representation of how diseases progress and how treatments work in a real human environment (Pampaloni et al., 2007).

Another example is organ-on-a-chip technology. How do you think this could change the biomedical innovation pathway and make treatments more personalized for patients?
