## Introduction
Welcome to this chapter on understanding how differences between socio-technical product service systems at various levels impact the health innovation pathway. In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, it is crucial to recognize the interplay between technology, services, and societal factors. This chapter aims to equip you with the knowledge to navigate these complexities and drive meaningful innovations in health.

Throughout this chapter, you will explore the nuances of socio-technical systems and their influence on health innovation. We will delve into case studies, theoretical frameworks, and practical examples to illustrate these concepts. Additionally, you will have access to engaging videos and quizzes designed to reinforce your learning and provide a deeper understanding of the material.

By the end of this chapter, you will be prepared to apply your newfound knowledge in a team project assignment. This collaborative exercise will challenge you to analyze real-world scenarios, propose innovative solutions, and demonstrate your ability to integrate socio-technical perspectives into health innovation pathways.

## Innovating with technology, organizations and people (TOP): Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS):

Socio-technical systems theory, as initially developed by Trist (1981), emphasizes the mutual shaping of social and technical elements within an organization. This approach is particularly pertinent to healthcare, where the interaction between human actors (e.g., healthcare providers, patients) and technical components (e.g., medical devices, health information systems) is complex and dynamic. Appelbaum (1997) further elaborates on the application of STS theory in organizational development, highlighting how it can drive innovation and improvement in healthcare settings.

A working definition of innovation by prof. Frido Smulders is:

```{admonition} Definition
"Innovation is introducing smoething new, into an existing context. This context, to accept the innovation, will undergo some changes."
```

**Generally, there are three key actors: people, technology and organizations:**

````{admonition} Prof. Frido Smulders explains the relevance of people, technology and organizations in the innovation pathway. What went wrong in the example of the aircraft?

Venturing into systems where value is created for users through different stakeholders and multiple interrelated services and products, such as in healthcare, public services, hospitality, and aerospace, is challenging. These systems are known as Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS). To operationalize this term in today's context where technology assumes many complex forms, we have added the product-service systems specification. This helps describe the complex environments in which today’s entrepreneurs operate. 

In STPSS, each stakeholder can create value in the health system. The value is created through the interaction of these stakeholders in a social process.

```{video} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqY1lQSozSc
```
````

Each stakeholder possesses explicable knowledge about their role and the system's functionality. Explicable knowledge, defined as implicit knowledge that can be made explicit during social interaction (Smulders, Lousberg & Dorst, 2008), forms a chain where products and services are interrelated. According to sociotechnical systems theory (Trist, 1981; Appelbaum, 1997), STPSS involves several individuals who shape a piece of technology or a product, or both, assigned to them within their own workplaces, creating an integrated chain of product-service value deliveries at the system level.

Entrepreneurs face significant challenges in developing an integrated new venture idea (NVI) that spans the entire value chain within an STPSS. Integrating the explicable knowledge of diverse stakeholders into an NVI is crucial, yet there has been little emphasis on the social process of knowledge interaction in NVI development.



## The health value you create: interaction between social determinants, digital determinants, stakeholders and evolving technology

Regarding our health, a STPSS is complex as there is an interaction with society, our digital environment, the organizations and technologies we are exposed to and which we use. Therefore, there is a complex interaction between people and health technology (e.g., electronic medical records). Understanding the healthcare STPSS, its actors, and their interdependencies is crucial. 

These interactions can be visualized by the social determinants. Some key factors influencing our health for instance are education, income and age (Dahlgren, G., & Whitehead, M. (2021). The Dahlgren-Whitehead model of health determinants: 30 years on and still chasing rainbows. Public health, 199, 20-24.).

```


To explain how these social determinants influence people's health, you can have a look at the figure below explaining how social determinants influence cardiovascular disease, a disease which has one of the highest impacts globally.

```{figure} ../figures/Hypertension-social-determinants-and-CVD.jpg
:name: figure-example

Conceptual framework on the digital determinants of health. Socioecological and life course approaches of social determinants of health leading to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Social determinants of health (SDOHs) encompass socioeconomic, political, and environmental contexts, including neighborhood poverty and poor housing conditions, social policies and built environment, public health policies and legislation, climate change and pollution, and crisis events. These SDOHs contribute to an increased risk of premature CVD and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) through health care system and psychosocial stress pathway, such as sympathetic-adreno-medullar and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. BP indicates blood pressure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CRP, C-reactive protein; and UPF, ultra-processed food. (Chaturvedi, A., Zhu, A., Gadela, N. V., Prabhakaran, D., & Jafar, T. H. (2024). Social determinants of health and disparities in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension, 81(3), 387-399.)
```

To get a good grasp on the impact of our societies on our health take a look at the TED talk video "How not to be ignorant about the world" by Hans and Ola Rosling.

What surprised you about the societal context of people? Did you know how many years women aged 30 spent in school? How do you think that impacts women's health?



In addition, all of the problems people face with their health are increasingly being mitigated by technology, that is why recently researchers have highlighted the impact of digital determinants as well.

## Situating the Problem-Solution in a patient journey touchpoint

When innovating in healthcare, it is crucial to understand the socio-technical context and map it out for the relevant innovation. This involves identifying the different elements within socio-technical product-service systems and situating the innovation within these systems to understand where it brings the most value. Value in healthcare is generated through the interaction of stakeholders, products, and services. Therefore, this process can be described in four steps (see figure). I revised the wording and presen the steps as follows:
1. Making the knowledge of stakeholders explicit (e.g. the clinical care path from different care professionals perspective, the operational procedures, protocols, daily work schedules of care professionals, patient activities)
2. Mapping it (e.g. on a patient journey format)
3. Integrating this knowledge so that it becomes clear how the problem manifest itself from different perspectives and how the solution adds value.
4. Validation of the journey 

```{figure} ../figures/Patient-journey-method-integrated-service-Albayrak.jpg
:name: figure-example

Process framework for the patient journey method. Simonse, L., Albayrak, A., & Starre, S. (2019). Patient journey method for integrated service design. Design for Health, 3(1), 82-97.
```
Collaborative design is crucial in making a patient journey, as it involves the active participation of all stakeholders to ensure that the innovation addresses their needs and concerns. Simonse, Albayrak, and Starre (2019) emphasize the importance of collaborative design in the patient journey method for integrated service design. Especially creative generative co-design, a more creative form of collaborative design, as discussed by Vandekerckhove, De Mul, Bramer, and De Bont (2020), highlights the importance of involving stakeholders in the design process to generate digital health solutions that are both practical and effective.

### 1. Making tacit knowledge of each stakeholder explicit

In healthcare innovation, it is essential to emphasize the importance of making tacit knowledge explicit from different stakeholders. Tacit knowledge, which is often unspoken and intuitive, plays a critical role in understanding the needs and experiences of patients, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. By capturing and articulating this implicit knowledge, innovators can bridge the gap between different stakeholders, fostering better understanding and collaboration. Insights from Smulders et al. (2008) underscore the need for effective communication strategies in collaborative design, essential for successful ventures in medical technology entrepreneurship.

### 2. Mapping the knowledge to develop a patient journey and identifying touchpoints

Patient experiences play a vital role in developing touchpoints within the care pathway. Touchpoints are key moments where the problem-solution becomes tangible and impactful. For example, Vandekerckhove, Vandekerckhove, Tavernier, De Jaegher, and De Mul (2020) explain how patient experiences can be used to develop touchpoints, making it clear where the problem-solution sits. Additionally, Simonse, Albayrak, and Starre (2019) highlight the importance of integrating service design with patient journey mapping to create a cohesive and effective healthcare experience. This often starts by mapping out the care pathway a patient follows in a certain timeframe (see figure below).

```{figure} ../figures/patient-journey-example.jpg

### 3. Integration process to situate the problem-solution

To effectively situate an innovation within a socio-technical product-service system, one needs to establish a patient journey as a result of an integration process. The socio-technical approach emphasizes the importance of considering both social and technical elements in healthcare systems. By mapping out the patient journey and care pathway, students can identify critical touchpoints where the innovation can provide the most value (see figure below, most interesting touchpoints are indicated with a light bulp).

```{figure} ../figures/touchpoints-vandekerckhove.png

```

### 4. Validating unique perspectives

By mapping health journeys, entrepreneurs can identify critical touchpoints and opportunities for innovation, thereby enhancing the overall patient experience. This methodology ensures that innovations, from ideation to scalable prototypes, address real-world challenges in healthcare delivery effectively. It is important to note that there are no general patient journeys; they are always highly individual. Therefore it is important to validate the relevance of your patient journey with other people from the same organization. It could be validated with other patient's unique experiences, or with the clinical guidelines to add alternative treatments or referrals. It requires a reflection on whether the unique value proposition captures that unique value in the touchpoint to see whether it is scalable in your target population (see Chapter on niche market).



## Value Creation on different levels

1. One could innovate to create value with a product in an existing system (e.g. in a hospital ward)
2. One could innovate to change the health services more broadly (e.g. in a hospital)
3. One could innovate to change the entire health system, this would typically be a disruptive innovation (e.g. a new class of treatments or a new type of remote care delivery, or theranostics)

Regarding the last level of innovation, the innovation changes the health system. Let's explore this by looking at how the system is traditionally represented: the healthcare landscape could be categorized into four key actors: patients, health care providers, regulators and third party payers. This value provision pathway could be described by looking at the relationships between these stakeholders. See this figure by Kraus: 

```{figure} ../figures/Kraus-21_Digital-transformation-traditional-Fig1.jpg
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

Stakeholders in a traditional healthcare system (Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.)
```

However, this landscape is changing. Increasingly new initiatives, like digital healthcare solutions, change the way value is created (Kraus, 2021). For instance,  a solution may not need a physical healthcare provider, the patient could self-manage, validate with an external care professional and treat a certain problem themselves. The system itself is changing as well. 

Have a look at this image from Kraus et al., which explains how digital technology reshapes the relationships in a digital health system

```{figure} ../figures/Kraus-digital-tech-health-system-potential-application.jpg
:height: 350px
:name: figure-example

Digital technology shaping the healthcare system. This figure indicates strenghts, weaknesses and threats in this transformation (Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., & Invernizzi, A. C. (2021). Digital transformation in healthcare: Analyzing the current state-of-research. Journal of Business Research, 123, 557-567.)
```

Further, remote healthcare solutions operate differently if the institutions are involved in a different way. For instance, new communication software or data infrastucture (5G) could allow each actor to play a different role.

Value in a socio-technical health system is created through the connection of different products and services. Over the past decades, the vision of value-based healthcare has influenced the health system, as value creation is increasingly discussed. Different methods of creating care, providing value to patients, and rewarding the value created (rather than merely the intervention) have been explored.


## Different value creation in Health Systems

Different countries have varying approaches to health insurance, coverage, and reimbursement for medical interventions. 

 Have a look at this video which describes how intentions of the implementation of new financial disease related group (DRG) structures in Germany has reduced the amount of hospitals, but not always in the right places. In addition, there is an increased focus on outpatient care, which is observed in other countries as well. Further, like many countries across the world, large investments are made in digital health.

* European Perspective (Bettina Maisch, Ines): Predominantly public, with national insurance schemes and stringent medical device regulations. Countries like Germany and France have universal health coverage with a mix of public funding and private insurance options for supplemental services. The European Union also has regulations such as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the proposed AI Act, which impact MedTech innovation.

* USA Perspective (Steven Howard): A mix of public (Medicare, Medicaid) and private insurance, with employer-based and market-driven models dominating. The system is highly fragmented, with significant disparities in access and costs. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage, but many remain uninsured or underinsured, and high healthcare costs remain a major issue.

* UK Perspective (Ben Harris): Publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) with supplementary private healthcare options. The NHS provides universal access, but wait times and resource constraints are ongoing challenges. Private insurance is available for faster access to certain treatments, but most essential healthcare services are state-funded.

* Latin America (Fatima Delgado, Jana Schmutzler): Varies by country; a mix of public and private systems, with efforts to extend coverage to underserved populations. Brazil has a universal public system (SUS), while countries like Mexico operate hybrid models where social security institutions cover formal workers, and private insurance is used for additional coverage. In some regions, challenges in reaching rural and indigenous populations persist.

* Africa (Ellen): Predominantly public healthcare with growing private sector involvement. Many countries rely on donor funding and international aid to strengthen health infrastructure. South Africa has a two-tier system with private healthcare catering to wealthier citizens, while public services face resource constraints. Efforts are underway to implement universal health coverage in some nations.

* Australia (Jacqueline Kerhahan, Maarten Ijzerman): A hybrid model, with Medicare (public) complemented by private insurance options. Government subsidies encourage private sector participation to ease public system burdens. Private health insurance is incentivized through tax benefits, ensuring better access to specialized care.

* Canada (Ken Redekop, Ryan Pulleybank): Publicly funded universal healthcare with some private insurance for supplementary services. Each province administers its own system, with national guidelines ensuring universal access. While essential services are covered, wait times for specialist care can be long, leading some to seek private solutions.

* China (ESHPM contacts, PhD students): A mix of public and private healthcare, with ongoing reforms to improve accessibility and affordability. Public insurance schemes cover most of the population, but out-of-pocket expenses remain high for specialized care. Government efforts focus on expanding healthcare access and integrating AI-driven solutions into medical practice.

## Surfing the waves in healthcare STPSS: human-centered care and value-Based Healthcare as catalysts for innovation

### Aligning with value-based healthcare

Value-based healthcare started with the seminal work of Porter (2010), with key principles to improve care: 
* Patient-Centered Care: VBHC emphasizes treating patients as active participants in their own care, focusing on their specific needs and outcomes.
* Outcome Measurement: Regular measurement and analysis of health outcomes are critical, ensuring that care interventions are effective.
* Cost-Effectiveness: VBHC seeks to achieve the best possible outcomes at the lowest possible cost, often involving cost management and efficiency improvements.

https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/cat.17.0558
TA add reading exercise: Try to identify how each stakeholder has a different perspective on value-based healthcare, which are the aim and means they put forward for value-based healthcare?


Even though it is a convincing framework, it is not as easy as it seems to implement. Yet, it can be an important catalyst for innovation and influence how you can harness this trend in your innovations.The concept of value-based healthcare is central to modern MedTech innovation. The "Implementing Value-Based Healthcare in Europe: Handbook for Pioneers" offers practical guidance on creating value within health systems. This approach focuses on improving patient outcomes while optimizing costs. Access the handbook here.

**Aligning your strategy with a value-based healthcare system approach**

 Many organizations have struggled for decades to find the right balance to provide the best value for money. In this session, we discuss key difficulties about the implementation of value-based healthcare based on the article by Reindersma et al. (2024) and Van Elten (2023).

Case Study: The Santeon Hospitals
The Santeon Hospitals in the Netherlands provide a practical example of VBHC in action. By collaborating across a network, these hospitals have implemented VBHC principles to enhance care quality and efficiency. Key elements include:

* Collaborative Learning: Santeon hospitals share data and best practices to continuously improve patient outcomes.
* Standardized Outcome Measures: They utilize standardized measures to track performance and identify areas for improvement.
* Patient Involvement: Patients are engaged in their care processes, providing feedback that informs quality improvement initiatives.

However, there are challenges and critiques of VBHC. Implementing standardized outcome measures can be difficult due to variations in patient populations and conditions. Additionally, focusing on cost-effectiveness might sometimes lead to under-provision of necessary but expensive treatments.

### Aligning your strategy with patient-centered care
Patients have a unique integrated view on the experience of healthcare, which is invaluable for healthcare innovation. Have a look at this article from patient expert Wim Sipma where he explains- that “service-dominant logic states that patients are the true creators of real value-in-use”.

Bosveld et al. (2024) highlight the experiences of patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare professionals with involvement in these programs. By empowering patients and caregivers to take an active role in their healthcare, entrepreneurial initiatives can improve outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction. This patient-centric approach is increasingly important in a healthcare landscape that values personalized care and patient engagement.

Focusing on how you make an impact on patients is essential as a recent report from OECD emphasized from the Patient-Reported Indicator Surveys that healthcare needs to deliver more for patients. ADD REF: OECD (2025), Does Healthcare Deliver?: Results from the Patient-Reported Indicator Surveys (PaRIS), OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/c8af05a5-en. 

When you are improving the STPSS it is important to take into account these three aspects to make sure you address the problems of patients:
* Patients value time
* Patients need personally tailored care
* Patients need trouble-free and safe care

Have a look at the key facts of the report below. Here you see how the STPSS elements are all related when and they manifest as an integrated experience from a patient perspective in their care pathway. For instance, primary care website are difficult to use, particularly for lower educated people. So how can you innovate in an inclusive way so that you make it more accessible? Often it comes down to reflecting on your unique value proposition. One point of reflection here is to think about, the necessary STPSS conditions that need to be in place to make an innovation succesful. Could your solution be that intuitive that you do not need to be a technology wizard to get it to work?

Personalized healthcare and precision medicine are related trends to value-based healthcare that may be useful to support innovations. By tailoring treatments to individual patients, personalized healthcare can potentially improve outcomes and efficiency, key goals of VBHC. It involves tailoring medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. These approaches diviate from standard care as it were as they become more individually tailored interventions. Personalized healthcare aims to move away from standardized healthcare with a "one-size-fits-all" model and towards treatments that consider individual variability (Collins & Varmus, 2015). These interventions use genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors to design more effective and personalized care plans.

Key aspects here are patient-related outcome measures (PROMS) and PREMS. Can you identify the innovations that are used to make the patient-centered a reality in a Danish hospital?

These trends are advanced through technological developments in the field of biotech. For example the use of complex multiplex cell cultures, which allows for more precise modeling of human diseases and testing of treatments. These cultures can replicate the interactions between different cell types within the body, providing a more accurate representation of how diseases progress and how treatments work in a real human environment (Pampaloni et al., 2007).

Another example is organ-on-a-chip technology. How do you think this could change the biomedical innovation pathway and make treatments more personalized for patients?

## The foundations of value creation: levels of Human Experience

Understanding how we experience our health and critical events in our lives is essential for healthcare innovation.

* experience of awareness



### Human awareness
There is an increasing amount of work being done in the field of human consciousness to explore what we feel as human beings on the experiential level of human awareness. However, the experiential level of human awareness is only beginning to be integrated into healthcare innovations.

To address the deeper problems behind patient experiences, it is crucial to apply generative co-design sessions and business development tools to guide strategic decisions across the basic innovation cycle. Generative co-design involves the active participation of stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and other relevant parties, to collaboratively create solutions that address their needs and concerns. (Vandekerckhove, De Mul, Bramer, and De Bont (2020))

By incorporating the tacit knowledge of stakeholders, innovators can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental level of human experience. This knowledge helps to identify the underlying issues that patients face and develop solutions that are truly patient-centered. 

In healthcare innovation, it is essential to emphasize that there are no general patient journeys; they are always highly individual. Understanding tacit knowledge from all stakeholders and mapping it out is crucial for creating meaningful and impactful innovations. (Simonse, Albayrak, and Starre (2019))

An example of addressing deeper problems behind patient experiences can be seen in the work of Mullaney, Pettersson, Nyholm, and Stolterman (2012), who emphasize the importance of human-centered design in cancer care. They highlight the anxiety experienced by cancer patients, which goes beyond the physical aspects of the disease. By understanding and addressing the emotional and psychological needs of patients, healthcare innovations can provide more holistic and effective solutions.

## Confrontation with pain, mortality and death

When looking at your diagnosis as a patient decades after the diagnosis happened, it is interesting how profound the emotions are and how traumatic the impact can be, even if the cancer is cured. Ultimately, through experience with disease, everyone is confronted with the limits of nature and their own mortality in some way. However, the expression of these emotions happens at different times. There seems to be a survival experience and a death experience.

### How to integrate double awareness in your solution?
The concept of "double awareness," as explored by Burgers et al. (2022), highlights how adolescents and young adults cope with an uncertain or poor cancer prognosis. This duality involves simultaneously acknowledging the possibility of survival and the reality of death. Patients often experience a complex interplay of hope and despair, which can lead to a heightened awareness of their mortality. This awareness is not only a confrontation with the potential end of life but also a profound reflection on the meaning and value of life itself.

The study emphasizes that coping with such a prognosis involves navigating between these two states of awareness. Patients may oscillate between moments of optimism and periods of deep existential reflection. This duality can shape their emotional and psychological responses, influencing how they perceive their illness and their future. The survival experience is marked by a determination to overcome the disease, while the death experience involves grappling with the fear and acceptance of mortality.

In essence, the confrontation with pain, mortality, and death is a multifaceted journey. It is a process that encompasses both the struggle to survive and the contemplation of life's fragility. Understanding this "double awareness" can provide valuable insights into the emotional and psychological challenges faced by patients, helping to inform more compassionate and effective support strategies.

### Framing experience: Nondualism, Zen 
In Western science, our experience is often conceptualized as a psychological construct through the concept of self. This idea suggests that our perceptions and emotions are filtered through our understanding of ourselves as distinct individuals. However, ancient philosophy, particularly from a phenomenological point of view, challenges this notion. Phenomenologists argue that there is no experience of a self; rather, experiences are direct and unmediated by any concept of self.

Eastern philosophy, particularly in the context of Japanese Zen, speaks of nondualism and no-self experiences as the true state of liberation from all sorrow. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Zen teachings emphasize the dissolution of the ego and the realization of one's interconnectedness with all things (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). This perspective offers a profound contrast to the Western conceptualization of self, suggesting that true peace and understanding come from transcending the self.

Pierre Hadot, in his book "Philosophy as a Way of Life," refers to ancient spiritual exercises designed to help individuals confront their mortality. These exercises, rooted in Stoic and Epicurean traditions, encourage a deep reflection on death as a means to cultivate a tranquil and virtuous life. Hadot's work underscores the importance of philosophical practice in preparing oneself for the inevitability of death, offering a path to inner peace and resilience (Hadot, 1995).


## Challenges to Integrate Patient Experience as Human Flux of Emotion, Which Is Always Changing Everywhere, Every Time

Ultimately, it is difficult to cater to human experience as it is always changing. On a meta-level, it might be interesting to facilitate mindfulness during the experience when people are using a specific new health solution. New technological advances with bio-sensors and theranostics are allowing us to cater better for a more holistic integrative medicine approach, which focuses more on wellbeing. However, this is just the beginning, and there are no standard business models yet developed for these product-services. It is important to strategically position the patient in a role that maximizes the value of your solution.

### Human-Centered Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Positioning the Patient as an Active Participant or Passive Receiver with Your Solution

The question arises: how do we develop solutions to create value for these changing situations, which are highly unique? Human-centered design and entrepreneurship could help us map out a broader understanding of the human experience in a particular situation in the care pathway. This can help discover new spaces to mediate and even prevent certain problems, such as anxiety for radiotherapy. Mullaney et al. (2012) emphasize the importance of human-centered design in cancer care, suggesting that understanding the patient's emotional journey can lead to better-designed interventions that address not only the physical but also the emotional aspects of care.

Some people are convinced that we need to empower patients more so that they can manage their own pathway better. For instance, the Academy for Patients and Informal Caregivers tries to equip patients with knowledge about that. Bosveld et al. (2024) highlight the significance of involving patients and informal caregivers in the treatment process, e-health, and self-management programs. Their study shows that when patients are more informed and involved, they can take a more active role in managing their health, leading to better outcomes and increased satisfaction.

In healthcare research, there are large streams of thinking about the involvement of patients in the care pathway, such as co-decision making in the consultation room or self-management of chronic diseases. Depending on the perspective you take, you frame the role of the patient in a different way, and this will determine the value you hope to create with your solution. By understanding the historical background of patient empowerment and self-management, we can better position patients in roles that maximize the value of our solutions.
