# 9. An open evidence-driven approach
(author: Dr. Pieter Vandekerckhove)

This book is driven and supported by research, but it also stimulates new research questions and new research initiatives. Here is an overview of the research that I have conducted; research in progress and new research questions I am exploring. All of this research came to fruition through great collaborations with fantastic colleagues. Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on these topics.

Below you find a brief overview of the research per chapter.

## Chapter 1: A philosophy of science for patient-centered entrepreneurship
Healthcare entrepreneurship is emerging as a field (Glover, Crocker, Brush, 2024). Before it was often discussed in the field of management and entrepreneurship as a context in which the management and entrepreneurship theories are applied. Often this happens on the macro and meso level across a health system or on a meso level across organizations. In this book we are focusing on the behaviors of healthcare entrepreneurship, and specifically on an individual level within healthcare organizations.

Entrepreneurial behavior in healthcare is also implicitly present in the fields of healthcare management, (technical) medicine, biomedical-engineering, and life sciences. However, these fields are looking at the objects, clinical procedures, patient outcomes and outputs of the innovations.

We focus on the underlying unique collaborative behavior of different stakeholders that results in improved patient outputs and outcomes. On the individual stakeholder level, the knowledge about strategies and management approaches to develop innovations in healthcare is scattered across different stakeholders with different background in different organizations. One of the most critical elements in designing effective innovation pathways is integrating these diverse stakeholder knowledge at the very beginning of the innovation process. Yet, they each hold tacit knowledge, which makes this knowledge siloed and difficult to access.

Key research questions: 

**Ontology**: what is the scientific framework to define patient-centered entrepreneurship as a set of collaborative behaviors? What is the patient-centered innovation cycle?

**Epistemology**: What methods can be used to advance in this field? What is the role of generative co-desing, front-loading and innovation theory?

**Axiology**: If we aim to make more impact for patients in sustainable and equitable way, with this moral obligation, how can these insights be used in practice and education?
