## Introduction

Pathways to improve the health system play a critical role to move from concept to implementation. Understanding these pathways allows innovators to design effective strategies, anticipate challenges, and optimize the development process. This chapter explores the relevance of innovation pathways, outlines the traditional biomedical innovation model, highlights the need for improvements in digital health and service-based innovations, and introduces key theories such as the IDER model and front-loading theory to enhance innovation strategies.

## A macro perspective: the traditional Biomedical Innovation Pathway 

The dominant biomedical innovation pathway follows a structured, often linear, process that includes fundamental research, preclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, and market introduction. This pathway has been well-established for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, ensuring safety, efficacy, and compliance with strict regulatory standards. Key steps in this process can be seen in the USA health system described with Figure 1 of this JAMA article [Sertkaya et al., 2024](#sertkaya2024).

```



In the phase before the marketing stage, one needs to gain access to the market. Every country has its own procedure for this. Have a look at this video by dr. Frederick Thielen about key issues that are happening in practice to go beyond the market access launch and get to a succesfull launc where patients actually get a new drug prescribed. What things should you consider upfront in this innovation pathway?

````{admonition} 3 Things About Market Access (dr. Frederick Thielen)
```{video} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NhuaohK_Qg
```
````


A key challenge here is to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of your drug, for example in The Netherlands. But what is cost-effectiveness? 

Look at this video from dr. Frederick Thielen:

````{admonition} 3 Things about cost-effectiveness (Dr. Frederick Thielen)
```{video} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMF2ddO9abM
```
````

Some parts of this pathway are in fact still a black box on more detailed level. Few people really know, what it takes for a drug to be fully become available to the market of a country. 

During these complex negotiations you need to agree on a price with the payer, be it a health insurer, the government or a hospital, or all of these together. Have a look at this video from prof. Carin Uyl-de Groot:


````{admonition} Watch this video of prof. Carin Uyl-de Groot. 

What are the key considerations about pricing negotiations one needs to consider upfront?
```{video} https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ZtwscRvEls?si=nAc2wJQuHHNV6YhY
```
````


While this pathway has describes key steps on the macro level for traditional medical products, it does not always accommodate the complexities of emerging innovations such as software-driven interventions (e.g., digital therapeutics like Germany's DiGA framework ([BfArM, 2024](#diga2024))) or theranostics (e.g., diabetes management integrating biomarkers and digital drug delivery). 

In Germany the new digital health assessment framework is an emerging step for digital health innovations.

## Front-loading in biomedical pathways with early Health Technology assessment
For strategic reasons, to front-load these concernsin the field of early Health Technology Assessment, has focused on how to reduce this risk early on. These new innovations demand more flexible, iterative innovation models. Ijzerman, Koffijberg, Fenwick, and Krahn (2017) emphasize the importance of early health technology assessment in medical product development, highlighting the need for more adaptive frameworks ([Ijzerman et al., 2017](#ijzerman2017)).

Next, we want to examine this pathway on a micro level at the level of individual behaviors to see how these look like.

## Micro level pathways: STPSS innovation pathways on an individual level

### Complex Product-Service Combinations

Innovation in healthcare now extends beyond pharmaceuticals and medical devices to include complex, service-oriented digital health solutions. Digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics, and virtual interventions using extended reality (XR) require pathways that account for evolving regulatory frameworks, interdisciplinary integration, and shifting healthcare dynamics. The traditional model must adapt to support parallel innovation processes that accommodate both technological and socio-economic considerations. Therefore, we need to rethink healthcare innovation models to effectively integrate these complex product-service combinations into routine care.

### Theories for the individual entrepreneurial level

A stronger theoretical foundation is required examine innovation processes on an individual level, especially in terms of translating ideas into care practices. Healthcare innovators must ultimately be able to reshape systems to support the adoption and sustainability of novel solutions. 


[Compton-Phillips (2024)](#comptonphillips2024) emphasizes the importance of care delivery innovation from care professionals in achieving this transformation. Underneath we will explore a few key theories one can use to help understand key dynamics in innovation pathways.  Ultimately it requires integrating service design principles, systems thinking, early health technology assessment, and implementation science. This can than develop frameworks that better support their healthcare innovations beyond traditional pharmaceutical and medtech pathway.

Underneath, we briefly describe these theoretical building blocks and later we will refer back to these theories to show how we applied them.

## A strategy to manage stakeholders in the innovation pathway

Often in entrepreneurship and design methods it is mentioned to map the relevant stakeholders. This is just the first step that is part of a stakeholder strategy for a sustainable innovation pathway. It is not only about knowing who is involved in your new idea, but also what knowledge you may need to prevent problems downstream in the innovation process.

### Why from the start? Front-Loading theory

 Front-loading theory emphasizes the importance of identifying key challenges early in the innovation process. Mapping potential bottlenecks—such as regulatory hurdles, sustainability concerns, workforce integration, and ethical considerations—at the outset allows for proactive problem-solving. [Dolfsma, Eijk, and Mahdi (2022)](#dolfsma2022) highlight that investing effort and resources early can mitigate risks and improve overall success rates in medical technology innovation. This would result in key strategic choices that need to be made about the time to involve stakeholders, the choice of stakeholders and the way they are managed.

### When to involve stakeholders? 

#### A continuous and iterative strategy: 
Circular innovation process: Problem-Solution Co-Evolution process ([Crilly, 2021](#crilly2021); [Dorst, 2019](#dorst2019)) (see also basic innovation cycle): Innovators should iteratively refine both the problem definition and the solution approach in response to emerging insights. Therefore it is important to be adaptive and be able to involve stakeholders on a continuous basis depending on the need of your innovation.

#### Depending on the innovation phase and aim: IDER Model: 
Balancing the involvement of stakeholders with knowledge of upcoming bottlenecs from multiple development streams. The IDER model: Initiation, Design, Engineering, and Realization, proposed by [Smulders (2022)](#smulders2022), challenges the notion of linear innovation pathways. Instead, it presents innovation as a set of interconnected, parallel processes that evolve dynamically. This approach acknowledges that various aspects of innovation (e.g., technological development, regulatory considerations, and market readiness) progress simultaneously rather than sequentially. Understanding this non-linear structure helps innovators navigate complex innovation ecosystems effectively.

```{figure} ../figures/IDER-Frido.png
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

Smulders, F. (2022). The IDER Model: Managing Parallel Processes in Innovation.
```

   
For example: ethical and societal Considerations may seem like a problem for market access, in the Realisation stage, but it is relevant to address early on in the Initiation phase – Incorporating ethical principles early is important to get people to want to use a new technology and governments to invest in ti, as discussed by [Jeroen van den Hoven (2021)](#denhoven2021) and Stefan Buijsman, ensures that innovations align with societal values and long-term sustainability (see WHO report on AI ethics: WHO AI Ethics Report and OpenWHO course: Ethics and AI ([WHO, 2022](#who2022))).


### Which stakeholders with what expertise and background?  

#### A stakeholder recruitment and assembly strategy 

The stakeholder group assembly procedure amounts to the operationalization of the Sanders and Stappers hypothesis that stakeholders with more diverse knowledge and ways of thinking could improve the GCD process ([Sanders & Stappers, 2012](#sanders2012)
). To involve stakeholders who meet these requirements in a GCD process, a procedure containing 3 steps was followed: snowball sampling, interviews, and assemblage of stakeholders (Figure 1).

##### 1. Snowball sampling

First, to recruit people, one needs to identify those who are committed to addressing the problem at hand. It can be useful to sample stakeholders through relevant organizations, associations, or events ([Pirinen, 2016](#pirinen2016); [Vandekerckhove et al., 2021](#vandekerckhove2021)). This should help ensure their commitment to solving problems, as these people have directly or indirectly been exposed to the problems and are logically more motivated to develop a solution.

###### Choosing stakeholders based on your innovation strategy: 

Herzlinger's Three Strategies, [Herzlinger (2024)](#herzlinger2024):
   - Internal Development – Leveraging in-house expertise and infrastructure to refine innovation early.
   - Growth Driver Strategy – Partnering with healthcare institutions and regulatory bodies to ensure alignment with market and policy requirements.
   - External Collaboration – Engaging external stakeholders, such as academic institutions and technology firms, to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and capabilities.

###### Managing diverse incentives and personal interests: 
Different stakeholders, researchers, patient, managers and other experts have different incentives and personal interests. As a researcher, or manager of the innovation process you may be confronted with three different ethical challenges ([Wittmayer et al., 2024](#wittmayer2024)):
* Axiological: people may have a different view on the organizational change and innovation and the societal impact it may have, these are rooted in values about what is considered to be "good". A future where the patient is considered to be disrespected in a certain way during the innovation may not be considered "good" for certain stakeholders, depending on their values about integrity.
* Ontological: the knowledge that is created can be used anywhere, some communities of patients may feel like people come in to ask their opinion and involvement, but they do not see the return and impact of the knowledge they helped to create
* Epistemological: certain knowledge and methods may be preferred by a dominant research or innovation manager, without taking into account local practices, these may be cultural bound as well (e.g. global north vs global south in settings where some ways of establishing knowledge are considered to be better than others), this is an important issue as healthcare practice is often rooted in tacit knoweldge and cultural practice, which has been establisehd over decades.

It is important to map out multiple variables e.g. stakeholder jobs, personal interest, needs for the patient, information asymmetry between all parties, problems for trust, which impacts the sharing of vulnerable new ideas. In addition, care provider organisations are controlled and checked for everyone’s safety. New ideas are generally not welcome beyond the narrow margin of error in every procedure.

Healthcare organisations are very hierarchical and time pressured environments. This produces many changing dynamics between the stakeholders:

* care professionals (caring, managing care process)
* Patients (getting better, managing life simultaneously) (this is different from the biomedical paradigm, patients are considered to be humans: [Whyte et al., 2024](#whyte2024))
* their families (helping patient)
* Managers (operationalizing care processes, financial management)
* industry parties (establishing relations, making profit)
* Government (assessing, controlling, evaluating care organizations)

There are different needs of the organization, personal interests, organizational goals and all these need to be seperated to come to a successful understanding and agreement to collaborate (https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/principled-negotiation-focus-interests-create-value/). These factors create tension between stakeholders. 

If you want to collaborate with these stakeholders and involve them and integrate their views representing some parts of the STPSS, one needs te be aware of these challenges ([Verkijk et al., 2024](#verkijk2024)). 

Therefore, given all these stakeholders there are different types of entrepreneurial activities needed to develop the new ideas and communicate them to the relevant stakeholder. 

In the beginning one use the involvement of users (micro-level), on a higher level one needs to convince the management teams of the organization (meso-level) and at the system level one needs to look at the interaction of the organizations (macro level) ([Kulkov et al., 2023](#kulkov2023)).


##### Where to find patients?
* Through your own network and social media
* Through care professionals
* the Patient Innovation Bootcamp or from Mens Achter de Patient Academy (Patient as a Person Foundation) in The Netherlands https://mensachterdepatient.nl/english/default.aspx 
* Relevant patient umbrella organizations who have an interest in collaboraive design innovation: e.g. for young adults with cancer https://ayazorgnetwerk.nl/
* Organizations which focus on getting patients more engaged in the care profess: Patient in Regie (Patient Engagement)


```{admonition} Manage the time for recruitment
:class: note 
Include relevant stakeholders early on is crucial but highly depends on your network, so use your own network of the network of key patner organizations. This can take a lot of time so make sure you mitigate the risk of not finding your preferred stakeholder and having alternatives on stand-by.
```


##### 2. Interviews

Second, individual interviews can be conducted to qualitatively assess the diversity of knowledge and ways of thinking of the potential members. To operationalize the term “knowledge,” we define 3 types of knowledge (Textbox 1) based on the work of Batens ([Batens, 1999](#batens1999); [Batens, 2004](#batens2004); [Batens, 2014](#batens2014)). One key form of knowledge that is also defined in GCD research is the deeper-lying tacit knowledge ([Sanders & Stappers, 2012](#sanders2012)), which we measure here as contextual certainties. In addition, there are methodological instructions and relevant statements. Each of these 3 types of knowledge was assessed during an interview on a scale of 0 to 3 (Table 1). Stakeholders with extensive knowledge regarding the relevant statements and contextual certainties will be given the maximum score (3); stakeholders who are uncertain are given a score of 2 and those who seemed to have little knowledge, or did not provide relevant information in the interview, were awarded lower scores (1 and 0, respectively).

To operationalize the other component, “thinking,” we define 4 types of inferences, namely, induction, deduction, abduction-1, and abduction-2 (Textbox 1), as categorized initially by Peirce (
[Cramer-Petersen et al., 2019](#cramerpetersen2019); [Burch, 2022](#burch2022); 
[Dorst, 2011](#dorst2011)). In particular, abduction-2 inferencing is expected to play an important role in the design process (
[Cramer-Petersen et al., 2019](#cramerpetersen2019); [Dorst, 2011](#dorst2011)) and is typically attributed to how designers think. Previous experience with these types of inferences can be assessed during an interview by counting the number of times an inference is used (Table 1). Abduction-1 can be scored as the number of methodological instructions formulated as concrete solutions (eg, having an overview of one’s energy capacity after cancer treatment to continue work). Abduction-2 can be scored by looking at the use of generative heuristics as analogies or metaphors.

In addition, communication skills can be assessed to determine whether potential stakeholders can effectively communicate their ideas to others in a group. For instance, we can assess whether a patient has the appropriate content expert background with various relevant statements that they feel confident to share during a GCD process with other stakeholders by asking the respondent for a self-evaluation.

##### 3. Assembly procedure

Third, after conducting the interviews and scoring the responses, a diverse stakeholder group can be assembled based on 3 criteria. One can start by combining people from different professional backgrounds. Next, one can ensure that those stakeholders with the highest knowledge scores are included as they have more knowledge. In other words, if there are 2 stakeholders with the same professional background, the one with the highest score is included. Finally, the diversity of inferencing experience can be assessed. Here, one should ensure that a stakeholder group covers all inference types. Once one is satisfied that the stakeholder group covers all inference types, one can seek out the stakeholders with the greatest inference experience. For instance, if there are 2 stakeholders with abduction-2 experience, the one with the most experience (highest score) can be selected.


### How to manage stakeholders along the innovation process? 


#### Managing uncertainty and decidability: C-K theory (Concept-Knowledge theory)  

This can be used to understand the importance of the mindset of stakeholders and which process the need to go through to develop a new idea in an organization. The theory also explains why it is important to involve certain stakeholders as experts from a knowledge domain and stakeholders with expertise in the conceptual domain.

C-K theory introduced by Hatchuel and Weil ([Hatchuel & Weil, 2003](#hatchuel2003)), offers a unified design framework that distinguishes between the space of Concepts (C) and the space of Knowledge (K), modeling innovation as the co-expansion of these spaces. Unlike traditional problem-solving approaches, C-K theory defines design as the generation of new concepts that challenge and extend existing knowledge, rather than merely selecting optimal solutions. The framework identifies four key operators (C→K, K→C, C→C, K→K), forming a “design square” that captures the iterative and dynamic nature of innovation.  

```{figure} ../figures/dynamic-C-K-Theory.png

:name: figure-example

Hatchuel, A., & Weil, B. (2003). A new approach of innovative Design: an introduction to CK theory. In DS 31: Proceedings of ICED 03, the 14th International Conference on Engineering Design, Stockholm.
```

The C-K theory helps one to move a team from a knowledge space domains, which are clear and decided into the uncertain and undecided conceptual domain. 


```{figure} ../figures/conceptual-knowledge-Frido1.jpg
:height: 350px
:name: figure-example

Frido Smulders, Figure A, https://www.tudelft.nl/en/innovation-impact/pioneering-tech/articles/innovation-is-about-behaviour-not-technology?utm_medium=email&utm_source=pt_newsletter_feb&utm_campaign=always_on#&gid=1&pid=1
```





This disjunction (see figure above) is challenging, but essential in healthcare organizations. The key challenges are:
1. There is an imense amount of knowledge, due to the vast amount of knowledge about certain diseases available
2. The relevant knowledge for a particular patient is scattered across many different stakeholders working in healthcare organizations. Often this knowledge is tacit. It requires people to drop their disciplenary knowledge (drop your tools theory) and rise above their domains to integrate the new solution into a new business operations structure. The generatice co-design sessions can help to make this knowledge more explicit (see below)

Conceptually, a team can move from the knowledge space to the C space and back. Note that the knowledge will have to be adapted in the new k-space to become a fully integrated solution (Figure below). 

```{figure} ../figures/drop-your-tools-frido.jpg
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

Frido Smulders, https://www.tudelft.nl/en/innovation-impact/pioneering-tech/articles/innovation-is-about-behaviour-not-technology?utm_medium=email&utm_source=pt_newsletter_feb&utm_campaign=always_on#&gid=1&pid=1
```



More generally, in healthcare innovation, C-K theory can help move beyond conventional pharmaceutical and medtech pathways. By structuring the innovation process around the interplay between conceptual exploration and knowledge structuring in an organization, this approach supports the development of more adaptive and interdisciplinary healthcare solutions. 

Looking at the innovation process in the healthcare organization, one could say that the operational space, is similar to the K space as it involves low uncertainty and it is decideable. However, there is also an innovation space, where things are much less certain. This changes according to the type of innovation process:
1. Steady state innovation
2. Sustaining innovation
3. Entrepreneurial innovation

 Have a look at the video of prof. Frido Smulders:

````{admonition} How to manage the stakeholders from the operational space (K space) to the innovation space (C space) back to the operational space with the new solution (new K space)? (prof. Frido Smulders) What are the differences between steady state innovation, sustaining innovation and entrepreneurial innovation?

```
````


Building on the C-K theory, how the different levels of value creation (see previous chapter) in the health system have different levels of innovation behaviour with different timeframes:

````{admonition} How does the undecidability and uncertainty change along the innovation pathway? (Prof. Frido Smulders)
```{raw} html

```
````

Ultimately we need to think how we can move the innovative behavior of people here from the K space to the C space.

Conceptually one could use the Deweyan theory of inquiry to develop certain steps in this process:

```{figure} ../figures/Deweyan-Inquiry-Frido.jpg

```

This means that in an organization people need to be able to get outside of their routines and outside of their comfort zones. Bringing stakeholders together in a psychological safe space is quintessential ([Smulders, 2024](#smulders2024)
).

```


#### Integrating the knowledge of stakeholders: Generative co-design sessions
In the field of human-centered design, Generative Co-Design (GCD) is considered to be especially promising as stakeholders are actively involved from the very beginning in the creation of products and services ([Moore et al., 2019](#moore2019); [Clemensen et al., 2017](#clemensen2017); [Sanders & Stappers, 2012](#sanders2012); [Langley et al., 2018](#langley2018); [Bird et al., 2021](#bird2021)
). This approach ensures that their needs are taken into account. A key hypothesis is that involving stakeholders is crucial as they provide important knowledge about their needs, which would otherwise be overlooked. Therefore, several authors claim that since the needs of stakeholders are better expressed through a co-design process, they can be better addressed in digital health solutions. Examples of these solutions include user guidance, specific reminders, and personal tracking ([Szinay et al., 2020](#szinay2020); [Steen et al., 2011](#steen2011); [Simonsen & Robertson, 2012](#simonsen2012); [Trischler et al., 2018](#trischler2018)).

Generative co-design helps especially to make the knowledge of each stakeholder explicit and integrate it into the innovation process steps and ultimately in the solution.

There are various methods and tools to use in generative co-design to integrate the knowledge of stakeholders in different phases in the innovation process.

```{figure} ../figures/HCD-tools.png

:name: figure-example

Human-centered design tools and techniques. Melles, M., Albayrak, A., & Goossens, R. (2021). Innovating health care: key characteristics of human-centered design. International Journal for Quality in Health Care, 33(Supplement_1), 37-44.
```

Generative co-design is one of the most interactive design methods to integrate the deeper conceptual knowledge (C space) of different stakeholders move it to a more explicit idea discussion, whereby the knowledge is made explicit (K space). In design terminology this iterative process between the C and K space would be called a co-evolution process. This method involves stakeholders actively in the design process to ensure that the developed solutions are user-centered and meet real-world needs. Vandekerckhove et al. also discuss how this theoretical framework can help us to decide how a good stakeholder group should be assembled:e.g. the type of stakeholders we involve in the entrepreneurial innovation activities.

For example: Application Example in Health Innovation for Young Adults with Cancer
Imagine a design team aiming to develop a new digital health platform for young adults with cancer. Using C-K theory, the process might unfold as follows:
 
1. **Concept Generation (C)**:
   - The team begins with the concept of a digital platform that addresses the unique psychological and social needs of young adults with cancer, beyond just medical treatment. This is an open-ended idea that requires further exploration.
2. **Knowledge Exploration (K)**:
   - The team conducts a literature review and engages with oncologists, psychologists, and cancer patients to gather existing knowledge. They find that young adults with cancer often face isolation, mental health challenges, and a need for peer support (Knowledge).
 
3. **C-to-K Transformation**:
   - The initial concept is refined based on the gathered knowledge. The team develops a more concrete idea: a mobile app that includes a social networking feature, mental health resources, and personalized content for young adults with cancer. This transformation is informed by their findings about user needs and existing technological capabilities.
4. **K-to-C Expansion**:
   - Using their existing knowledge of mobile app development and user interface design, the team generates new concepts. They brainstorm additional features such as virtual support groups, telemedicine integration, and gamified health tracking.
5. **C-to-C Evolution**:
   - The team engages in iterative design thinking sessions, where they continuously expand and refine their concepts. For instance, they might explore the idea of incorporating AI-driven personalized content suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.
6. **K-to-K Integration**:
   - As they test prototypes with users, they gather new data and insights, which expand their knowledge base. They learn about specific user preferences and challenges, such as the need for anonymity in support groups or the importance of easy navigation for users undergoing treatment.
 
#### Example in Practice
**Developing a Health App for Young Adults with Cancer**:

**Step 1: Initial Concept (C)**:
   - The team starts with a broad concept: a supportive digital environment tailored to the needs of young adults with cancer.

**Step 2: Gathering Knowledge (K)**:
   - Research and interviews reveal that these patients often feel isolated and crave connection with peers who understand their experience.

**Step 3: Refined Concept (C-to-K)**:
   - Based on this knowledge, the concept evolves into an app with social networking features, access to mental health professionals, and community events.

**Step 4: Generating New Concepts (K-to-C)**:
   - Leveraging their knowledge of digital health technologies, the team brainstorms additional features like telemedicine consultations and mood-tracking tools.

**Step 5: Iterative Expansion (C-to-C)**:
   - The team prototypes these features and conducts user testing, continuously refining the app. They might add new features like AI-driven health tips based on user activity.

**Step 6: Knowledge Integration (K-to-K)**:
   - Feedback from testing informs the next iteration. They discover, for instance, that users prefer video support groups over text-based forums, leading to further refinement and knowledge integration.

By applying C-K theory in this way, the design team can effectively navigate the complexities and uncertainties of creating a health innovation tailored to young adults with cancer, ultimately developing a more impactful and user-centered solution.
Research by Pieter Vandekerckhove highlights the transformative potential of generative co-design in healthcare, such as improving cardiology consultations through enhanced user experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic ([Vandekerckhove et al., 2020](#vandekerckhove2020)). Generative co-design, as elaborated by Vandekerckhove et al. (2020) in their systematic literature review, is a participatory approach that involves users throughout the design process. This methodology ensures that the final product is shaped by the needs and preferences of its users, leading to more effective and user-friendly health interventions.


## Key insights from practitioners about collaboration to take into account upfront
Developing your innovation pathway is like an action-research process where you learn from every step you take. 

Some key lessons could be shared here when looking as key aspects in the innovation pathways. What aspects do you identify as important in patient-centered innovation pathways? What aspects should be considered upfront?


````{admonition} In this video Pieter Vandekerckhove discusses with a patient expert and founder of startup and a representative of the Dutch regulatory body about the challenges in innovation pathways. What are three main insights you would need to take into account upfront from their perspective?

ADD PANEL DISCUSSION from Intro MedTEch 2024 with Johan de Munter + startup night recording

THERANOSTICS: It is important to assess the roadblocks for existing solutions and learn from their mistakes in their pathways: today one could couple the existing interventions that can help with diagnostics and couple them with new interventions.

```{tip}
TA Change to case study format: Use national organizations: case from Dutch AYA network (see latest article from Carla, Sophia and I): innovation through national support organizations (In publication)
```

```{tip}
TA Change to exercise format: For example a foundation developed a succesful serious game in the USA called Re-mission 2 you could try to leverage that game with new technologies to improve wellbeing in personalized XR environments. This would be an innovation pathway bringin exisitng innovations together and working towards a market access strategy that may involve a reimbursement strategy https://hopelab.org/case-study/re-mission/. Re-mission 2 showed benefits in terms of improved adherence to treatment and indicators of cancer-rleated self-efficacy and knowledge in young people with cancer, and it seems that they did not apply for FDA approval. A potential strategy could be to use a middle-growth strategy and work with pharmaceutical companies to leverage support for market access in conjunction with an existing or new treatment.

## Conclusion

Innovation pathways in healthcare are evolving to accommodate new technological and service-driven advancements. Traditional biomedical models provide a foundation but must be expanded to support parallel processes, digital solutions, and ethical considerations. By applying the IDER model, front-loading theory, and Herzlinger’s strategic approaches, innovators can navigate complex pathways more effectively, leading to more successful and impactful healthcare solutions.
