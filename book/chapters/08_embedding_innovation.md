## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare entrepreneurship, the ability to integrate innovation sustainably within an organization and scale it across other healthcare organizations is crucial. You may not expect this, but by now you have probably realised that developing a delightful and excellent product that perfectly fist the market needs is not enough to gain traction in STPSS health systems. This chapter aims to help you start to develop a strategy for embedding innovation processes and developing a plan with key innovation pathway steps towards long-term sustainability and impact. By understanding and applying these strategies, you can ensure that your innovative ideas are effectively integrated into your organization, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and growth.

## Key Innovating Behaviors in Steps

- **Problem Identification**
- **Solution Prototyping**
- **Validation**

In practice, these steps are more complex and involve co-evolution cycles. These steps require a specific mindset and a space to do this.

### Strategy Development

Develop a strategy to change the mindset from solution-driven to problem-driven.

## Structural Support

The structure to support processes needs to be adapted to the organization. It is difficult to find time and the right people at the right time. It is important to find individuals who are interested in spending extra time on innovation.


Healthcare organizations operate in a system with an endless demand for healthcare services. Unlike other industries, they are not necessarily incentivized to innovate for increased turnover or higher-quality care. Given this context, it is crucial to create dedicated spaces and frameworks that enable innovation while aligning with the broader organizational mission.

## Orchestrating dedicated fuzzy conceptual spaces in a rigid knowledge organization
In a healthcare organizations, many different stakeholders, like care professionals are often implicly being creative. Creativity is situated and a living thing as dr. Milene Goncalves describes (see Cascini, G., Nagai, Y., Georgiev, G. V., Zelaya, J., Becattini, N., Boujut, J. F., ... & Wodehouse, A. (2022). Perspectives on design creativity and innovation research: 10 years later. International Journal of Design Creativity and Innovation, 10(1), 1-30.). For example creativity is situated in care organizations as care professionals often need to look for the best treatment for the patient. Yet, often the problem is not clear and there are multiple possible diagnoses and not one treatment. In a way, it requires them often, albeit very briefly, to be creative and collaborate and share ideas, often in multidiscplenary team meetings. However, to innovate, one needs to enlarge that space and find ways to incorporate that innovative thinking more in the organization. If creativity could exist in Type 1 (quick ideas) and Type 2 (refinement and judgement), Goncalves and Cash propose that it could be better to have more iterations of the quick ideas and come up with better ideas (ADD REF Gonçalves, M., & Cash, P. (2021). The life cycle of creative ideas: Towards a dual-process theory of ideation. Design Studies, 72, 100988.). If one is aware of these tendencies in practice, it can help to develop better ideas.

Yet, creating that space and time in a safe way in a complex regulated organization is challenging. From a theoretical point of view the organization must make space to think beyond the existing knowledge. That means, moving from a knowledge space to a conceptual space as Hatchuel and Weil have described (REF Hatchuel, A., & Weil, B. (2003). A new approach of innovative Design: an introduction to CK theory. In DS 31: Proceedings of ICED 03, the 14th International Conference on Engineering Design, Stockholm.) 

Leading health care organizations have developed an innovation spaces to experiment with new ideas outside their usual operational scope. For instance, Mayo Clinic’s Center for Innovation fosters design-driven healthcare improvements (TA Change APA REF [Yale Insights](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/can-design-thinking-reshape-an-esteemed-institution)). Erasmus Medical Centre has a special unit Create4Care where you can walk-in and prototype your idea and they also are growing their hospital based incubater and validation program. (ADD KEY REF). The Munich University Hospital uses a simulation space:

```
````


Some hospitals also apply these design thinking principles actively, Kaiser Permanente applies human-centered design to improve patient experiences and streamline care deliverythe specialized Rotterdam Eye Hospital also witnessed the changes of using design thinking to understand the human perspective and the personal connection to improve health care experiences (ADD REF Deichmann, D., & Van der Heijde, R. (2017). How design thinking is improving patient-caregiver conversations. Harvard Business Review.).(add also REF Roel van der Heijde https://roelrotterdam.nl/blog/how-design-thinking-is-improving-patient-caregiver-conversations/)

 By embedding innovation teams within their operations, they ensure that new ideas are tested and implemented in real-world healthcare settings. However, tensions often arise between care professionals focused on traditional medical practice and those who take a more entrepreneurial or design-oriented approach. Tim Brown (IDEO) and dr. Nicholas LaRusso (Mayo Clinic) highlight the importance of bridging science, design, and healthcare through design thinking.

What are the key challenges discussed in the video for healthcare organizations to use design thinking?

But, how do that on an individual level? It may just be worthwile to have people do a small meditation exercise to become more creative. (see REF Schootstra, E., Deichmann, D., & Dolgova, E. (2017). Can 10 minutes of meditation make you more creative. Harvard Business Review.). For further reading see: Goleman, D., & Davidson, R. J. (2018).

## Developing a Strategic Starting Point
To successfully introduce innovation in the organization, it is important to connect to a broader mission. The organizations need a purpose-driven mission that aligns with  trends and strategies that are influenced by other stakeholders, like the government policies, such as:
- **Value-Based Healthcare** – Enhancing patient outcomes while managing costs.
- **Cost Efficiency** – Streamlining healthcare delivery to optimize resource use.
- **Provider-Driven Innovation** – Encouraging frontline professionals to identify and implement new solutions.


## Synergizing Innovation with Organizational Behavior
Healthcare organizations are often hierarchical, heavily regulated, and accustomed to incremental rather than radical innovation. Given these constraints, successful innovation requires:
- **Navigating Administrative Structures** – Understanding regulatory and operational boundaries.
- **Identifying Key Stakeholders** – Engaging leadership, clinicians, and administrative staff at different levels.
- **Aligning with Leadership** – Securing buy-in from executives and department heads.

## Look for change leaders to champion your quest
Once key individuals are identified, assessing their personalities and motivations is essential to identify early partners or leaders of cha

nge in the organizaiton (see NEJM Catalyst ref on leading by example). Resources such as *Healthcare by Design: A User’s Guide to Healthcare Improvement* (Barry Katz et al., 2025) provide tools looking for like-minded people with the right characteristics for healthcare innovation.

## Communication and pitching your idea to different people in the organization

Explaining the innovation mission to various stakeholders requires tailored communication strategies. Given the complex social dynamics of healthcare, innovators need sufficient resources to facilitate discussions and integrate new ideas into existing frameworks. Research suggests that fostering collaborative communication is key to successful implementation ([Smulders, Lousberg, & Dorst, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1108/17538370810883819)).

Different people in the organization will have different incentives to focus on innovation and changes next to their core activities. That is why it is crucial to use those 20 seconds or 1 minute ot your maximum advantage. Try to come across in a professional way. Try to practice your pitch with people or sign up with the Toastmasters platform https://www.toastmasters.org/ and join a club and you can even gain free access to a **generative AI tool Yoodli that analyzes your pitch: https://www.toastmasters.org/myhome/welcome-to-yoodli

**Conclusion**

Innovation in healthcare organizations requires a strategic approach that aligns with existing structures, engages key stakeholders, and fosters a culture conducive to change. By leveraging purpose-driven missions, effective communication, and strong leadership, organizations can create sustainable innovation pathways that improve healthcare delivery.


## Develop a Strategy for Your Innovation Pathway

It is crucial to front-load the knowledge you have gathered so far about the upcoming challenges in your innovation pathway. Each of these decisions may change your strategy and priorities of how to move forward. Ultimately, it comes down to risk management and making hard decisions to align your unique value proposition with a niche market and beachhead market strategy. Following that approach you develop a key hypothesis and validate that through different forms of research.  If it doesn't work you change and make a pivot. Note that changes can be very costly and demotivating so be very careful to have a risk mitigation strategy in place beforehand in terms of your operational process (e.g. decoupling the production processes), but also your financial strategy.

You can use advisors, develop your own board of advisors, or use the support from organizations like Health Innovation Netherlands. They offer services to understand perspectives and give strategic advice for further development. This involves a multi-stakeholder assessment exercise for implementation, business model questions, evidence development strategy, and registration. see Round Table service https://www.healthinnovation.nl/round-table-service/subsidy-programs

```{admonition} Team Project Assignment (see project chapter 9)
:class: important 
Develop an innovation pathway strategy report which presents convincing arguments based on scientific references and your research for your  innovation pathway strategy that addresses the following points:
- **Business Model Development**: 
  - Address business model questions to ensure your innovation is viable and sustainable. Consider market demand, revenue streams, and scalability. 
  - If there is no regulatory framework for your innovation yet, you will have to be creative and come up with alternative reveneu streams to build towards that scenario. In that case you will also need a political or lobby strategy in place to liaise with the local and national health authorities.

- **Plan for collaborative solution prototyping**: 
  - Identify points where you need to brainstorm and prototype potential solutions. Utilize co-evolution cycles to refine and improve your ideas through iterative feedback and testing.
  - Identify the resources (materials, labarotory, staff, production and logistics chain) you will need for that prototyping strategy

- **Validation and Feedback**: 
  - Implement validation steps to test your prototypes with and evidence generating pipeline to gain market access, taking into account the regulatory framework in the health system. 
  - Gather feedback from stakeholders and adjust your solutions accordingly to ensure they meet the needs and expectations.

- **Multi-Stakeholder Assessment**: Conduct assessments involving multiple stakeholders to identify challenges and opportunities. Use these insights to strengthen your innovation strategy.

- **Organizational embedding strategy**: 
    - Develop a comprehensive strategy for integrating your innovation into the organization, from a bottom-up perspective, it should be clear how it will change the patient care pathway. From a top down perspective it should be clear how the chief of department and hospital will create, resources available like space (e.g. new advanced operation theatre or biotech lab) and a support staff budget plan. The support plan is especially relevant for licensing software packages maintenance, troubleshooting and updates. Outline key steps, timelines, and resources needed for successful implementation.
   - **Develop a plan to create a problem-Driven Mindset**: Explain how you will shift the focus of the organization from finding immediate solutions to your problem to thoroughly understanding the problem. Encourage your team to explore the root causes and underlying factors in an iterative way.
   - **Leverage External Support**: Utilize advisors and external organizations like Health Innovation Netherlands to gain strategic advice and support. Incorporate their insights into your innovation pathway.

- **Evidence and Registration**: 
  * Develop an evidence strategy to support your innovation and navigate the registration process. Ensure you meet regulatory requirements and have robust documentation.
  * Draft a scientific article format text about your prototype pilot results

Master/graduate level: 
* Develop an innovation pathway for your project, whereby you outline the key hypothesis, the risks and a risk mitigation strategy
* Include that in a pitch deck and full report following the structure of basic innovation cycle to present this to the key decision makers (heads of departments, boards)
