## Preface


Healthcare innovation holds immense potential to improve lives, yet many promising ideas never reach the patients who need them most. As an educator and researcher at TU Delft, I have seen how technical breakthroughs often struggle to scale beyond prototypes, failing to integrate into hospital systems or national healthcare policies. This challenge is not just technical, it is fundamentally entrepreneurial.

This realization led me to develop and teach a course on healthcare entrepreneurship, aimed at equipping students with the knowledge and skills to navigate this complex landscape. Over the years, I have seen how a multidisciplinary, interactive approach fosters a deeper understanding of what it takes to bring healthcare innovations to market. However, I also recognized the limitations of traditional classroom teaching. I wanted to extend this learning experience to a much wider audience, both at TU Delft and beyond.

**The Aim of This interactive handbook**

This book is designed as an actionable methodology for innovators working in the trenches of healthcare organizations. Whether you are a care professional, patient, hospital manager, health insurer, startup founder, policymaker, researcher, or simply someone passionate about improving healthcare, this handbook is meant to empower you to drive change.

By combining expert panel discussions, interactive quizzes, and discussion forums, this book seeks to replicate and enhance the interactive learning experience of the classroom. Instead of passively consuming information, readers are encouraged to engage, reflect, and discuss—just as they would in a face-to-face setting.

The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between healthcare innovators and real-world adoption. This book provides practical tools to help innovators understand how to scale their solutions, navigate complex healthcare systems, secure funding, and integrate new technologies within existing infrastructures.

**Who Should Read This interactive handbook?**

This handbook is for anyone committed to transforming healthcare through innovation, including:

* Care professionals and patients seeking to improve healthcare delivery from within.
* Healthcare organization managers in hospitals, insurance companies, and care networks who need strategies for adopting and scaling innovation.
* Startups and entrepreneurs aiming to bring new health solutions to market.
* Policymakers and government officials working on healthcare innovation and regulation.
* Academics and researchers looking to translate discoveries into real-world applications.
* Anyone motivated to make an impact with their innovative drive in the healthcare system.

By making this book open and interactive, I hope to foster a global learning community where knowledge is co-created rather than just consumed.

I also see this as a living document—one that will evolve with new insights, contributions, and discussions.

Developing this handbook has been an exciting and challenging journey, made possible with support from the Open Education Stimulation Fund; many students and colleagues around the world, thank you to all! I invite you to explore, engage, and contribute to this evolving resource. Together, we can shape the future of healthcare innovation.

(**For teaching assistants**: to assess the learning outcomes of the book: quiz here with suggestion what is the main insights people want to get out of the interactive handbook, we need to be able to extract the data on the back-end)
