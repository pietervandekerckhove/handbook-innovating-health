## Introduction

Understanding the types of resources and funds required for survival and the structure of financial revenue streams is crucial for healthcare innovation. This chapter will guide you through mapping out different revenue streams at various levels, including care organizations, regional networks, and national organizations. This will help you to strategically assess how to develop your prototype from a paper sketch to functional minimum viable product with a financial plan underlying your prototype development.

## Mapping Revenue Streams

Identify and map out the various revenue streams at different levels:
- Care organization
- Wider network of organizations on a regional and national level

For example, does the ward have an innovation budget? What about the hospital, health insurer, or government?

```{tip}
Start assessing and modeling how your innovation can reduce costs. Many hospitals aim to be more efficient within the budget provided by health insurers. Look at the case of a circular healthcare initiative that made a business case by showing how they reduced costs to the hospital by reusing medical waste material. Refer to page 91 in the open textbook 'Creating a Circular Healthcare Economy': https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/1507
```

## Integrating Revenue Streams

Integrate a revenue stream into the patient journey and solution map. Consider strategies for research funding in the first five years (See slides by Steve).

## Types of Funding

There are different types of funding you can look for:
- **Pre-seed funding**: Funding to improve and develop the idea towards a prototype (see K voucher funding)
- **Larger public funding grants (EU)**: Strategic themes on an EU level
- **Crowdfunding strategies**
- **Venture capital investments**

Strategically, it is important to seek organizations that can provide financial support in various ways and understand your mission about value-based healthcare:

Another strategy is to protect your idea with intellectual property.

## A Focused Financial Strategy: Identifying a Beachhead Market

Using your resources wisely is important, especially in the beginning. Invest in developing your idea with more research, building a functional prototype, or running a feasibility test. It could be used to build a minimum viable product.

### From Wide Vision to Beachhead Market Strategy

After developing a wide vision for your unique value proposition, focus on the first entry point where the interests of all stakeholders align. This approach will help you concentrate your efforts to achieve initial cash flow: a beachhead market strategy.

### TAM SAM SOM

Calculating your addressable beachhead market can be done in three steps:

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Estimate the total market demand for your product or service if you achieved 100% market share.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: Determine the segment of the TAM that your product or service can realistically serve based on your business model and capabilities.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: Identify the portion of the SAM that you can capture in the short term, considering your current resources and competitive landscape.

```{tip}
Exercise: What could be the beachhead strategy for this initiative? The unique value proposition supports managing chronic disease crises during treatment with a virtual avatar providing a mindfulness intervention.
```

```{tip}
When pitching your idea to investors, irrespective of the level, it is important to use the right terminology and show the right numbers. It is a good practice to start from the TAM SAM SOM calculations to show the market size. Check out these videos here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-innovation-entrepreneurship

## Conclusion

In conclusion, effective resource management and financial strategies are essential for the success of healthcare innovations. By understanding and mapping out revenue streams, integrating them into the patient journey, and identifying appropriate funding sources, you can ensure the sustainability and growth of your innovation. Focus on a beachhead market strategy to align stakeholder interests and achieve initial cash flow. Protecting your idea with intellectual property and using the right terminology when pitching to investors will further strengthen your financial strategy.

```{admonition} Team Project Assignment (see project chapter 9)
:class: important 
* Identify a niche
* Identify a beachhead market with TAM, SAM, SOM calculations and a unique value proposition and key reveneu streams
* Draft a grant proposal to gain strategic funding to develop and test a key hypothesis with your prototype


Master/Graduate level:
* Identify the key financial issues you foresee that are necessary to front-load early in the innovation pathway and justify your selection of stakeholders accordingly.
* Calculate a financial strategy for 2 years and 5 years, showing basic elements in your balance sheet and taking into account alternative payment models and complex revenue streams
