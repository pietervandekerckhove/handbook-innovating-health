## Introduction

Understanding the types of resources and funds required for survival and the structure of financial revenue streams is crucial for healthcare innovation. This chapter will guide you through mapping out different revenue streams at various levels, including care organizations, regional networks, and national organizations. This will help you to strategically assess how to develop your prototype from a paper sketch to functional minimum viable product with a financial plan underlying your prototype development.

## Financial strategy for innovators and entrepreneurs

Continuously iterating your business model and integrating sustainable revenue streams is very important. 

See below the case study of 23andme who failed bankruptcy in March 2025.  This recent testimonial of 23andme after their bankruptcy highlights the importance to continuously iterate and front-load important insights in the complex biotech field where you need a sustainable business model. How can we make more sustainable business models to help bring genetic insights to the patients with more impact. Apart from private investors, which revenue streams exist for emerging biotech platforms?

Is their approach to 'own' the genetic data of people the right approach? How would a sustainable business model look like where people can own and manage their genome? This is the time where we need to make strategic decisions to make sure the patient is in the right position when using these solutions.

Post of Anne Wojcicki on LinkedIn, 24/03/2025: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/annewojcicki_the-23andme-special-committee-released-news-activity-7309798830110085121-8T0i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAhp1AYB5FV3XTEC865Ew1w94LtFLLE1uO4: The 23andMe Special Committee released news today indicating their plan to take the company through the Chapter 11 process.   While I am disappointed that we have come to this conclusion and my bid was rejected, I am supportive of the company and I intend to be a bidder.   I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder. 

Nineteen years ago, when I co-founded 23andMe, the direct to consumer industry did not exist and most people had no idea why they would ever want to see their genome.   So much has changed.   There is now a thriving direct to consumer industry and over 15 million people are now 23andMe customers.   These customers are continuing to learn about their family relationships and how to optimize their health thanks to the incredible team of individuals at 23andMe who innovate and help customers gain insights from their genetic information. 

What made so many of our innovations possible were the 85% of our customers who opted in to research.  Thanks to them they have empowered an incredible platform for discovery.  You enabled our pursuit into novel drug discovery and our 50 programs with GSK.   In addition, over 250 publications have come out because of you and we have meaningfully impacted the research world.   Thank you. 

We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering.  Consumers are rising up and asking for more control over their health and want greater knowledge about how to be healthy and why they may have health issues.   We fought for consumers to have direct access to their information and for them to have choice and transparency with respect to their personal data.   As I think about the future, I will continue to tirelessly advocate for customers to have choice and transparency with respect to their personal data, regardless of platform. 

Since 2006, we have built an incredible consumer brand with one of the world's largest and most diverse genetic communities. Our foundation was the trust and respect of our customers, and they were always the guiding light on how we made decisions. If I am fortunate enough to secure the company’s assets through the restructuring process, I remain committed to our long-term vision of being a global leader in genetics and establishing genetics as a fundamental part of healthcare ecosystems worldwide.

## Mapping Revenue Streams

Identify and map out the various revenue streams at different levels:
- Care organization
- Wider network of organizations on a regional and national level

For example, does the ward have an innovation budget? What about the hospital, health insurer, or government?

```{tip}
Start assessing and modeling how your innovation can reduce costs. Many hospitals aim to be more efficient within the budget provided by health insurers. Look at the case of a circular healthcare initiative that made a business case by showing how they reduced costs to the hospital by reusing medical waste material. Refer to page 91 in the open textbook 'Creating a Circular Healthcare Economy': https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/1507
```

## Alternative payment models, accountable care organizations (Steve)



## Integrating Revenue Streams

Integrate a revenue stream into the patient journey and solution map. Consider strategies for research funding in the first five years (See slides by Steve).

## Types of Funding

There are different types of funding you can look for:
- **Pre-seed funding**: Funding to improve and develop the idea towards a prototype (see K voucher funding)
- **Larger public funding grants (EU)**: Strategic themes on an EU level
- **Crowdfunding strategies**
- **Venture capital investments**

Strategically, it is important to seek organizations that can provide financial support in various ways and understand your mission about value-based healthcare:

Another strategy is to protect your idea with intellectual property.

## A Focused Financial Strategy: Identifying a Beachhead Market

Using your resources wisely is important, especially in the beginning. Invest in developing your idea with more research, building a functional prototype, or running a feasibility test. It could be used to build a minimum viable product.

### From Wide Vision to Beachhead Market Strategy

After developing a wide vision for your unique value proposition, focus on the first entry point where the interests of all stakeholders align. This approach will help you concentrate your efforts to achieve initial cash flow: a beachhead market strategy.

### TAM SAM SOM

Calculating your addressable beachhead market can be done in three steps:

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Estimate the total market demand for your product or service if you achieved 100% market share.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: Determine the segment of the TAM that your product or service can realistically serve based on your business model and capabilities.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: Identify the portion of the SAM that you can capture in the short term, considering your current resources and competitive landscape.

Exercise: What could be the beachhead strategy for this initiative? The unique value proposition supports managing chronic disease crises during treatment with a virtual avatar providing a mindfulness intervention.
```

```{tip}
When pitching your idea to investors, irrespective of the level, it is important to use the right terminology and show the right numbers. It is a good practice to start from the TAM SAM SOM calculations to show the market size. Check out these videos here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-innovation-entrepreneurship

## Conclusion

In conclusion, effective resource management and financial strategies are essential for the success of healthcare innovations. By understanding and mapping out revenue streams, integrating them into the patient journey, and identifying appropriate funding sources, you can ensure the sustainability and growth of your innovation. Focus on a beachhead market strategy to align stakeholder interests and achieve initial cash flow. Protecting your idea with intellectual property and using the right terminology when pitching to investors will further strengthen your financial strategy.
