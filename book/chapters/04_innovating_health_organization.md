### Key entrepreneurial behaviors

### Defining Healthcare Technology

According to the WHO's "Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025," digital health, leverages technology to enhance healthcare delivery systems globally. This includes wearable health monitors, diagnostic imaging systems, robotic surgery, and digital health applications. (ADD REF https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020924)This includes a broad range of product-service systems. For example: devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures, and systems developed to solve health problems and improve quality of life. These technologies facilitate the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases. Healthcare technology integrates advancements from various fields, including biotechnology, information technology, and medical devices, to enhance patient outcomes and streamline healthcare operations.

**Trends in Health Technology**

The Politecnico di Milano's Technology Foresight report https://www.foresight.polimi.it/health/1/ provides insights into future trends and innovations in healthcare technology. This foresight is critical for anticipating and preparing for upcoming challenges and opportunities in MedTech. Emerging trends include AI-driven diagnostics, precision medicine, telehealth expansion, and the integration of blockchain for secure health data management. These advancements drive efficiency, accessibility, and personalized care, paving the way for transformative changes in the healthcare industry. 

**Why Is Healthcare Innovation So Hard?**

Healthcare innovation is notoriously challenging due to multiple structural, regulatory, and behavioral barriers. As outlined by Herzlinger (2006) in "Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard," several factors contribute to this difficulty. 

Please read the article: "Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard": In this seminal article, Herzlinger identifies several systemic barriers that make healthcare innovation particularly difficult. She argues that the complexity of healthcare systems, coupled with regulatory constraints, misaligned incentives, and risk-averse stakeholders, creates a challenging environment for new innovations to thrive. The article highlights key factors contributing to these difficulties, such as fragmented healthcare markets, resistance to disruptive change, and the challenge of balancing scientific rigor with market-driven entrepreneurial strategies. Herzlinger emphasizes the need for strategic alignment between policymakers, investors, and healthcare providers to foster an ecosystem conducive to sustainable innovation.

````{admonition} Important
``` Therefore the question rises: How to align incentives, deal with risk-averse stakeholders upfront? In a health system many stakeholders have a misalignment between the financial incentives and the need to innovate targeting patient outcoems of interest. For example, when you are innovating to improve the wellbeing of patients, you cannot do that in the standard health system, because there is no reimbursement or incentive to innovate interventions going beyond the biomedical interventions of patient outcomes. Finding a sustainable business model in this area is an important challenge for all digital wellbeing tools.

**Key aspects to take into account**:
* Lack of Entrepreneurial Strategy: Many promising innovations fail to achieve long-term impact due to the absence of a strategic entrepreneurial approach. Without a clear business model, funding strategy, and implementation plan, innovations remain underutilized.

* Scientific vs. Entrepreneurial Behavior: The healthcare system is predominantly driven by scientific discoveries, which often lack integration with entrepreneurial mindsets necessary for commercialization and widespread adoption.

* Transdisciplinary Complexity: Innovation in healthcare requires expertise spanning multiple disciplines, including:

        Philosophy
        
        Management and strategy

        Organizational sciences

        Health sciences and economics

        Technology sciences

        Patient expertise

        Law and regulations

        Psychology

        Creativity

        Ethics

        Human-centered and strategic design

        Entrepreneurship

* Beyond Organizational Boundaries: Healthcare innovation inherently spans across organizations and multiple stages of the innovation process. It involves collaboration between fundamental research institutions (e.g., universities) and clinical practice, necessitating coordinated efforts for successful implementation.

By adopting a strategic entrepreneurial approach, healthcare organizations can overcome these challenges and drive impactful innovations. This requires fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, developing clear implementation pathways, and aligning technological advancements with patient-centered needs and market viability.
