## Introduction
In this chapter we will explain the team project with the aim to apply generative co-design sessions and business development tools to guide strategic decisions across the basic innovation cycle with a team challenge. In this process you will follow the steps of the IDER model, but instead of doing every process in paralel, you need to go through the process in a linear way with the basic innovation cycle.

## Key steps in your project: basic innovation cycle
In the innovation process there is a basic cycle that we can follow:

## 1. Initiation: getting  started
### Assemble your team
Get Everyone on Board: The first step in any successful project is assembling a team that is committed and enthusiastic about the project's goals. Ensure that each team member understands the vision and objectives, fostering a sense of shared purpose and collaboration.

In case you do not have a team yet go through the stakeholder assembly procedure in chapter 5 (add link). In case you have been assigned a team, skip the recruitment step and map out the knowledge domains and skills of every team member.

### Project management
1. Develop a Team Name: Creating a team name can help build identity and unity. A team name fosters a sense of belonging and can be a fun way to encourage team spirit and camaraderie.

2. Assign Roles and Tasks: Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member based on their skills and expertise across the timeline of your course or project. Assign specific tasks to ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them and can contribute effectively to the project's success.

Leverage collaborative Tools
1. Google Docs: Use Google Docs for real-time collaboration on documents. It allows multiple team members to work simultaneously, share feedback, and make edits, ensuring that everyone stays on the same page.

2. Notion: Notion is a versatile tool for task management and organization. It can be used to create to-do lists, track progress, and manage project timelines, helping the team stay organized and focused.

3. Miro: Miro is excellent for creative making and prototyping. It provides a virtual whiteboard where team members can brainstorm ideas, create mind maps, and develop prototypes collaboratively, fostering creativity and innovation.

By leveraging these principles and tools, teams can work more efficiently and cohesively, driving the project towards successful completion.

"Harnessing the Benefits of the Sea in Healthcare

Overview: Humans have a deep-rooted connection to the sea, with some biologists suggesting our evolutionary origins in aquatic environments explain our affinity for the ocean. This connection can be harnessed to enhance healthcare practices both on land and offshore, providing holistic benefits to various populations.

Current Issues: Traditional healthcare often overlooks the potential benefits of natural environments like the sea. Patients, especially those in remote or offshore locations, face significant challenges in accessing quality care. On land, exposure to natural seascapes is not sufficiently integrated into treatment plans, missing out on proven mental and physical health benefits. Offshore populations, such as those in floating cities or remote sea-based communities, have limited access to healthcare services, creating gaps in continuous and comprehensive care.

Your Challenge: Develop innovative solutions to integrate the therapeutic benefits of the sea into healthcare practices and improve access to care for offshore populations. This involves creating effective digital healthcare platforms for remote diagnosis and treatment, establishing physical healthcare facilities on or near the sea, and incorporating natural seascapes into land-based treatments to enhance patient outcomes.

Objective: Design a solution that:
1. For Offshore Populations:
   - Implements robust telehealth systems to provide remote diagnostics, consultations, and continuous care.
   - Establishes mobile or floating healthcare facilities equipped to handle emergencies and routine care.
   - Ensures seamless integration with land-based healthcare systems for specialized treatments.

2. For Land-Based Interventions:
   - Incorporates natural seascapes into treatment environments, utilizing the calming and restorative effects of the sea.
   - Promotes outdoor therapies and activities near coastal areas to enhance mental and physical health.
   - Develops educational programs for healthcare professionals to integrate natural seascapes into treatment plans effectively.

Present your proposed solution through detailed plans and prototypes, backed by research and case studies. Schedule meetings with stakeholders for feedback and validation, ensuring the solution is practical, scalable, and capable of making a significant positive impact on healthcare delivery both on land and at sea."


## 2. Explore
The aim of this phase is to explore the different levels in the problem and develop a need statement. First you need to narrow down the challenge into a hypothesis, aferwards you need to choose a detailed focus of that reframed challenge.

### Top-down mission or bottom up health needs exploration
The above challenge can provide you with a starting point, but you need to think much bigger and leave the K-space to venture in the C-space. You can start with a top-down vision where you want to arrive or you can start to explore the problem by conducting research and interview people that are suffering from the problem.

### Top-down mission
It is essential that you build a mission and vision and try to clarify what the general aim would be. 

It could be a great benefit if you have someone related to your initiative who has been feeling the pain firsthand and wants to make a change.

## Develop and rephrase the needs statement
Develop a need statement in the format of: "A way to address (problem) in (specific population) in order to (achieve a desired outcome)". Afterwards rephrase it in the format of a hypothesis

### Research the hypothesis from different stakeholder perspective
Often people from the industry are solution driven and people in health practice are needs driven, these are two different mindsets. Make sure you explore both approaches to the problem.

#### Types of research tools
Conduct exploratory research to find out more about the underlying problem about the need hypothesis and potentially validate your need hypothesis.

Generally there are three types of research you can conduct: literature review, interviews and observations. Please use the resources that are most convenient to you, but make sure you have a better understanding about the hypothesis you formulated earlier.

General approach to start: try to formulate Who..., What..., Where..., How... and Why questions to get started with your research. Initially, try to explore the unknown areas where you have least amount of knowledge.

Literature: you can use publicly available search robots such as Google or Google Scholar. If you are looking for health-related research you can use PubMed https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/. If you don't have access to one of the scientific articles you need and don't know anyone who can access through their university affiliation, you can ask the EIT Health Innovation training team.

Interviews: Ideally, you can get in touch with one or two key stakeholders in the field. Look for friends or family you may have indirectly or directly experienced this problem.

Tips for the interview: Address someone politely and focus on the person you want to interview to ask the right questions, it can be useful if one person asks the questions and someone else just takes notes.

Dig deep: don't be afraid to ask a lot of why questions to bring out that deeper knowledge and listen very actively to what is being said. Don't just focus on "thoughts": also try to bring out the emotional side of the story as this can give a good idea of ​​what the problem feels like. Try to use open questions and avoid closed yes or no questions as this can cause you to confirm what you already know. As exemplified in this video of the Mom-Test, asking closed questions can implicitly cause all your respondents to confirm your questions. 



Observation: Look for a relevant place, such as a potential healthcare organisation you have access to. Be invisible: try to stand in a corner like a plant, yes we mean that almost literally. Be in the middle of the action, where the problem may be, but in a place where you are unnoticed, where everyone can easily walk past you, so you are not immediately noticed. Above all, make sure you have permission to be there and not infringing on the privacy of the people you are observing.

These questions can help you:
What don't you see? What's not happening? Things that you expect to happen, but don't happen can be important to better identify the problem.
What do you see? What will happen? Things that you obviously expect to happen would be easy to miss because it makes so much sense, still write down these logical events in relation to the problem situation. Is this a logical place? A logical sequence of actions? What facial expressions or nonverbal responses do you see?

Conducting the field research: absorbing information
Make sure you have all the material ready for the interview(s) or observations:

pen/paper for drawing and writing, a sketch can sometimes say more than words and you can also easily use this in the visual analysis afterwards
photo camera, video camera (smartphone), make sure your smartphone is charged and always ask permission first to take photos or make videos of the people in the picture

You can structure your data collection and data analysis in the table shown underneath:

```{figure} ../figures/Data-table.png
:height: 150px
:name: figure-example

Data analysis table-Pieter Vandekerckhove
```
			
To properly analyse the data you can use coding software like Atlas.ti or ENVIVO and more recently there are also experimental generative AI or automation tools to transcribe interviews and analyze them. This is what a startup focused on called Qaring (folded). 

You could also use validated AI research tools to review large bodies of literature like ASReview https://asreview.nl/. Here are some open exercises https://github.com/asreview/asreview-academy?tab=readme-ov-file#open-teaching-materials

```

#### Problem behind the problem
It is really important to dig deeper than the superficial information you receive and try to find out what the deeper lying information is about.

Based on the research, try to identify an underlying, more fundamental need: the problem behind the problem. For instance, you realise that the problem with chemotherapy is not in the first instance receiving the treatment as such, it is actually the idea of receiving chemotherapy as a destructive poison that is causing mental stress.

Here you can use a mindmap to structure your thoughts and look for underlying problems. A mindmap can be made in three steps:
start with a central concept in the central node
branch out of the node with related concepts
draw connections between the nodes
look for new insights when you feel you have saturated the mindmap

(INSERT EXAMPLE OF MINDMAP)
			

#### The fudamental level of human experience

It is important to understand how we experience our health and critical events in our life. And there is increasing amount of working being done in the field of human counsiousness to explore what we field as a human being on the experiential level of human awareness. However, the experiential level of human level is only starting to beginning to become integrated in healthcare innovations.

### Clinical problem validation, mapping out care pathways and patient journeys over time

When looking at your diagnosis as a patient decades after the diagnosis happened it is interesting how profound the emotions are and how traumatic the impact can be, even if the cancer is cured.

Here is a video of the comedian Tom Green who shared his experience shortly after diagnosis:

Try to gather key details about the patient journey around the problem space to work out a patient-level cost analysis of the pathway to quantify the pain point even better.
For example, see this paper mapping subfertility pathways by dr. Maura Leusder: Patient-level cost analysis of subfertility pathways in the Dutch healthcare system  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-024-01744-5

## 3. Design and create: prototype minimum viable solution

### Aim
The aim of this session is to generate a solution to your need statement. This is the phase where you can be very creative!

Watch this video from the TU Delft open course on Entrepreneurship for engineers from dr. Victor Scholten. In this video they explain that we ultimately want to get a good understanding about the problem-solution fit and turn that idea into a reality in the form of a prototype.

### 1. Develop a customer/user/patient profile
### 2. Develop a persona
### 3. Brainstorm
### 4. Select the idea and create a value proposition for that idea

Different types of prototypes
need for research approach with hypothesise to validate assumptions with prototype

Validation prototype types: functional, aesthaethic, cost impact

## 4. Robustinize: Testing problem-solution hypotheses
At this stage you will focus on identifying and testing a beachhead niche market in the Socio-Technical Product Service Systems (STPSS) of a niche area in the health system. Your task is to select a specific segment within the healthcare industry that represents a promising niche market for your innovative solution.

Dap Hartmann: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFdtwWNz_T0?si=HtHMfDqybHqCDZAE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Steps to Complete the Assignment**:

1. **Develop a Niche Market Strategy**:
   - Conduct thorough market research to understand the needs, preferences, and pain points of your chosen segment.
   - Develop a targeted marketing strategy to position your solution effectively within this niche.
   - Utilize strategic selling techniques to engage potential customers and gather feedback.
   - **Formulate Three Key Hypotheses**: Identify three key hypotheses related to your niche market strategy that you want to validate. Describe a validation plan for each hypothesis, detailing how you will test and measure its accuracy.

2. **Calculate Market Sizes**:
   - **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Estimate the total market demand for your product or service if you achieved 100% market share.
   - **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: Determine the segment of the TAM that your product or service can realistically serve based on your business model and capabilities.
   - **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: Identify the portion of the SAM that you can capture in the short term, considering your current resources and competitive landscape.
   - **Formulate Three Key Hypotheses**: Identify three key hypotheses related to your market size calculations that you want to validate. Describe a validation plan for each hypothesis, detailing how you will test and measure its accuracy.

3. **Develop an Integration Strategy**:
   - Create a plan to integrate your innovative solution into the existing healthcare ecosystem. This includes identifying potential partners, aligning with regulatory requirements, and ensuring seamless adoption by users.
   - **Formulate Three Key Hypotheses**: Identify three key hypotheses related to your integration strategy that you want to validate. These hypotheses should take into account key assumptions about the revenue streams in the market niche you have identified. Describe a validation plan for each hypothesis, detailing how you will test and measure its accuracy.

Your goal is to validate the viability of your solution within the selected beachhead market and refine your business model based on the insights gained from this testing phase. This will involve estimating market size, pricing strategies, and potential sales volumes to create financial assumptions that project the costs, revenues, and profitability of entering this niche market.

### Applying for grants
It is very important to communicate the stage of your idea clearly (funding bodies would typically call that Technology readiness levels (TRL)), your unique value proposition and the outcomes you would like to achieve. This would have to be translated so that people can understand how it fits in the outcome of their team and organizations. Here it is always important to understand the role of your intellectual property strategy and it is worthwhile to think about how you will balance that in comparison with scientific open communication about your findings.

You may not be familiar with academic essay writing. That's ok, here are some tips:

* You can watch a few videos about academic writing from TU Delft open education library
* TA: ask permission and include video with exercise underneath:
https://ocw.tudelft.nl/course-lectures/academic-writing-general-pitfalls-getting-started/

 Try to use this structure:
* Introduction with a question or statement
* You answer your questions and you use scientific references to substantiate your argument
* you conclude with one sentence about the key message of your essay

Tips for a grant proposal:
* assemble a team with a track record in your area, preferably one or more key partners has access to patients, clinical trial administration and care professionals
* assemble a writing team and meet regularly to develop your grant proposal
* align your proposal with the criteria of the funding body: e.g. for EU grants, it is important to take into account the larger EU Competitive theme into account: https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness_en


## 4. Realize: embedding strategy
starting simple validation to more complex validation
1. early in practice validation

Try a feasibility like this Virtual reality application combined with neurofeedback (see Rolbiecki, A. J., Craig, K., Polniak, M., Smith, J., Ghosh, P., & Mehr, D. R. (2023). Virtual reality and neurofeedback for Management of Cancer Symptoms: a feasibility pilot. American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine®, 40(3), 291-298.)


2. early HTA And evidence gathering for prototyping evalutation strategy and clinical evalutation strategy

```{tip}
Look for creative places in your organization, like the Create4Care lab at Erasmus MC or Rotterdam Square validation processes, you can use to validate clinical aspects of your innovation
