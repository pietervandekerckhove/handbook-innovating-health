## Introduction
In this chapter we will explain the team project with the aim to apply generative co-design sessions and business development tools to guide strategic decisions across the basic innovation cycle with a team challenge. In this process you will follow the steps of the IDER model, but instead of doing every process in paralel, you need to go through the process in a linear way with the basic innovation cycle.

## What is the basic innovation cycle?
In the innovation process there is a basic cycle that we can follow:

## What is the patient-centered innovation cycle?
Building on the basic innovation cylce, the patient-centered innovation cycle further specifies in each phase how stakeholder knowledge can be strategically used from the very beginning of the innovation process to maximize impact. This strategy helps to mitigate risk to prevent future unnecessary costs and delays.

There are 5 phases:
* PHASE 1: Initiation: assemble a stakeholder team and a stakeholder involvement strategy to mitigate future risks
  
* PHASE 2: Exploration (observe and question): define a needs statement and a key research strategy to identify key risks in the innovation pathway
  
* PHASE 3: Design & Create (ideate): develop a strategic prototype to test a key hypothesis upfront with a selected group of stakeholders to integrate key insights to mitigate future risks
  
* PHASE 4: Robustinize:
develop a sustainable revenue strategy to prevent financial risk
   
* PHASE 5: Integration (Experiment and contextualize): develop an integration strategy to make sure to prevent the innovation is embedded into th health system, reducing the risk of not impacting patients

## 1. PHASE 1: Initiation: getting  started

### Assemble your team
Get Everyone on Board: The first step in any successful project is assembling a team that is committed and enthusiastic about the project's goals. Ensure that each team member understands the vision and objectives, fostering a sense of shared purpose and collaboration.

In case you do not have a team yet go through the stakeholder assembly procedure in chapter 5 (add link book/chapters/04_stakeholders.md). In case you have been assigned a team, skip the recruitment step and map out the knowledge domains and skills of every team member.

### Project management
1. Develop a Team Name: Creating a team name can help build identity and unity. A team name fosters a sense of belonging and can be a fun way to encourage team spirit and camaraderie.

2. Assign Roles and Tasks: Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member based on their skills and expertise across the timeline of your course or project. Assign specific tasks to ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them and can contribute effectively to the project's success.

Leverage collaborative Tools
1. Google Docs: Use Google Docs for real-time collaboration on documents. It allows multiple team members to work simultaneously, share feedback, and make edits, ensuring that everyone stays on the same page.

2. Notion: Notion is a versatile tool for task management and organization. It can be used to create to-do lists, track progress, and manage project timelines, helping the team stay organized and focused.

3. Miro: Miro is excellent for creative making and prototyping. It provides a virtual whiteboard where team members can brainstorm ideas, create mind maps, and develop prototypes collaboratively, fostering creativity and innovation.

By leveraging these principles and tools, teams can work more efficiently and cohesively, driving the project towards successful completion.

"Harnessing the Benefits of the Sea in Healthcare

Overview: Humans have a deep-rooted connection to the sea, with some biologists suggesting our evolutionary origins in aquatic environments explain our affinity for the ocean. This connection can be harnessed to enhance healthcare practices both on land and offshore, providing holistic benefits to various populations.

Current Issues: Traditional healthcare often overlooks the potential benefits of natural environments like the sea. Patients, especially those in remote or offshore locations, face significant challenges in accessing quality care. On land, exposure to natural seascapes is not sufficiently integrated into treatment plans, missing out on proven mental and physical health benefits. Offshore populations, such as those in floating cities or remote sea-based communities, have limited access to healthcare services, creating gaps in continuous and comprehensive care.

Your Challenge: Develop innovative solutions to integrate the therapeutic benefits of the sea into healthcare practices and improve access to care for offshore populations. This involves creating effective digital healthcare platforms for remote diagnosis and treatment, establishing physical healthcare facilities on or near the sea, and incorporating natural seascapes into land-based treatments to enhance patient outcomes."

Objective: Design a solution that:
1. For Offshore Populations:
   - Implements robust telehealth systems to provide remote diagnostics, consultations, and continuous care.
   - Establishes mobile or floating healthcare facilities equipped to handle emergencies and routine care.
   - Ensures seamless integration with land-based healthcare systems for specialized treatments.

2. For Land-Based Interventions:
   - Incorporates natural seascapes into treatment environments, utilizing the calming and restorative effects of the sea.
   - Promotes outdoor therapies and activities near coastal areas to enhance mental and physical health.
   - Develops educational programs for healthcare professionals to integrate natural seascapes into treatment plans effectively.

Present your proposed solution through detailed plans and prototypes, backed by research and case studies. Schedule meetings with stakeholders for feedback and validation, ensuring the solution is practical, scalable, and capable of making a significant positive impact on healthcare delivery both on land and at sea.


## 2. PHASE 2: Explore
The aim of this phase is to explore the different levels in the problem and develop a need statement. First you need to narrow down the challenge into a hypothesis, aferwards you need to choose a detailed focus of that reframed challenge.

The above challenge can provide you with a starting point, but you need to think much bigger and leave the K-space to venture in the C-space. You can start with a top-down vision where you want to arrive or you can start to explore the problem by conducting research and interview people that are suffering from the problem.

### Defining your take on the challenge: Top-down mission-driven approach
It is essential that you build a mission and vision and try to clarify what the general aim would be. 

It could be a great benefit if you have someone related to your initiative who has been feeling the pain firsthand and wants to make a change.

->**Ultimately you need to define your challenge with stakeholder involvement strategy to front-load their knowledge**

### Develop the needs statement
After you have chosen a challenge, you need to develop a need statement in a clear formate that shows the problem and the underlying problem. 
1. First summarize your challenge in your own words in one sentence.
2. Rephrase your challenge into a one sentence hypothesis
3. Conduct the explorative research
4. Develop the revised needs statement

```{tip}
Need statement key elements: As we observe (problem), we actually want to address (problem-behind-the-problem) in (specific population) in order to (achieve a desired outcome)

For example:  As we observe **anxiety** during cancer treatment, we actually want to address **post-traumatic stress** of **young cancer patients** in order to give them a better **quality of life** so that the can perform daily tasks better.
```
#### 1. First summarize your challenge in your own words in one sentence.

#### 2. Rephrase in a hypothesis
To transform your challenge idea into a concise one-sentence hypothesis, start by clearly identifying the core problem or need you aim to address. Focus on the specific patient-centered issue and the potential impact of your solution. Frame your hypothesis by stating the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected outcome. 

This should be like a preliminary value proposition:

For example, "We believe that implementing a mobile health app for chronic disease management will improve patient adherence to treatment plans and enhance overall health outcomes." This hypothesis will guide your research and help you validate the need for your proposed solution.

##### Research the hypothesis from different stakeholder perspective
Often people from the industry are solution driven and people in health practice are needs driven, these are two different mindsets. Make sure you explore both approaches to the problem.

#### 3. Explorative research tools
To better understand the underlying problem and potentially validate your need hypothesis, it's essential to conduct exploratory research. This research will help you gain deeper insights into the need hypothesis you formulated earlier.

There are three primary types of research you can conduct: literature review, interviews, and observations. Use the resources that are most convenient for you, but ensure you gain a comprehensive understanding of your hypothesis.

**General Approach to Start:**
Begin by formulating Who, What, Where, How, and Why questions to guide your research. Initially, focus on exploring unknown areas where you have the least amount of knowledge.

**Literature Review:**
Utilize publicly available search engines such as Google or Google Scholar. For health-related research, you can use PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

**Interviews:**
Ideally, connect with one or two key stakeholders in the field. Look for friends or family members who may have indirectly or directly experienced the problem.

**Tips for Interviews:**
- Address interviewees politely and focus on asking the right questions.
- It can be helpful if one person asks questions while another takes notes.
- Dig deep by asking many "why" questions to uncover deeper knowledge.
- Listen actively to what is being said and try to bring out the emotional side of the story.
- Use open-ended questions and avoid closed yes/no questions to prevent confirmation bias. As demonstrated in the Mom-Test video, closed questions can lead respondents to confirm your assumptions.

```{video} https://youtube.com/watch?v=eIaTCcU-bQs&si=ZWKzF26l6WDGOcrh
```
````


**Observation:**
Find a relevant place, such as a healthcare organization you have access to. Be as unobtrusive as possible—try to blend in like a plant in the corner. Be in the middle of the action where the problem may occur, but in a spot where you are unnoticed. Ensure you have permission to be there and are not infringing on anyone's privacy.

**Observation Questions:**
- What don't you see? What's not happening? Identifying expected but absent events can help you better understand the problem.
- What do you see? What is happening? Write down logical events related to the problem situation, even if they seem obvious. Consider the logical sequence of actions and any facial expressions or nonverbal responses you observe.

**Conducting Field Research:**
Make sure you have all the necessary materials ready for interviews or observations:
- Pen and paper for drawing and writing—sketches can sometimes convey more than words and can be useful in visual analysis later.
- A photo camera or video camera (smartphone)—ensure your smartphone is charged and always ask for permission before taking photos or videos of people.

**Data analysis:**
You can structure your data collection and data analysis in the table shown underneath:

```

#### 4. Revised need statement
It is really important to dig deeper than the superficial information you receive and try to find out what the deeper lying information is about.

Based on the research, try to identify an underlying, more fundamental need: the problem behind the problem. For instance, you realise that the problem with chemotherapy is not in the first instance receiving the treatment as such, it is actually the idea of receiving chemotherapy as a destructive poison that is causing mental stress.

Here you can use a mindmap to structure your thoughts and look for underlying problems. A mindmap can be made in three steps:
start with a central concept in the central node
branch out of the node with related concepts
draw connections between the nodes
look for new insights when you feel you have saturated the mindmap

(INSERT EXAMPLE OF MINDMAP)

## 3. PHASE 3: Design and create: prototype minimum viable solution

The aim of this phase is to generate a solution to your need statement. This is the phase where you can be very creative!

Watch this video from the TU Delft open course on Entrepreneurship for engineers from dr. Victor Scholten. In this video they explain that we ultimately want to get a good understanding about the problem-solution fit and turn that idea into a reality in the form of a prototype.

### 1. Develop a customer/user/patient profile
Here, you will develop a detailed profile of a key stakeholder who will directly benefit from your solution. We will start with the information gathered in the previous need statement and move towards a human-centered approach by focusing on one particular stakeholder.

#### Step 1: Identify Key Stakeholders

Begin by making a list of the most important stakeholders involved in your project. Consider individuals or groups who will be directly impacted by your solution. Here are some examples to get you started:

- **Customers**: These are the individuals who will purchase or use your product or service. Understanding their needs and preferences is crucial for creating a solution that meets their expectations.
- **Users**: These are the people who will interact with your product or service on a daily basis. Their feedback and experiences will help you refine and improve your offering.
- **Patients**: In the healthcare sector, patients are often the primary beneficiaries of innovations. Identifying their specific needs and challenges will guide you in developing solutions that enhance their well-being.
- **Healthcare providers**: These professionals play a key role in delivering healthcare services. Understanding their workflows, pain points, and needs will help you create solutions that support their work and improve patient care.
- **Family members**: Family members often play a significant role in the healthcare journey of patients. Considering their perspectives and needs can lead to more holistic and supportive solutions.
- **Community members**: The broader community can be impacted by healthcare innovations. Engaging with community members can provide insights into public health needs and opportunities for community-wide benefits.

#### Step 2: Visualize Pains and Needs

To visualize the pains and needs of a specific person, we will use The Value Proposition Canvas: Customer Profile (Strategyzer). This tool helps you personalize the specific needs and pains of users by describing activities in their daily lives.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ReM1uqmVfP0?si=HA02vrsLoAHwutoQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


**Why is this relevant?**

- **Human-centered approach**: By focusing on the specific pains and needs of stakeholders, you ensure that your solution is tailored to address real-world challenges. This approach increases the likelihood of adoption and success.
- **Empathy and understanding**: Visualizing pains and needs helps you develop empathy for your stakeholders. This understanding is crucial for creating solutions that truly resonate with users and improve their experiences.
- **Targeted innovation**: By identifying specific pains and needs, you can prioritize features and functionalities that directly address these issues. This targeted approach leads to more effective and impactful innovations.

Watch the video below for more information about the value proposition canvas. The first part of the video focuses on the customer profile, and later we will create the value map.



#### Integrating Human-Centered Approach and Empathy

By integrating the human-centered approach and empathy into the innovation process, healthcare entrepreneurs can create solutions that are not only effective but also deeply resonant with the people they aim to serve. This integration involves:

- **Engaging with stakeholders**: Regularly interacting with patients, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to gather insights and feedback.
- **Personalizing solutions**: Tailoring solutions to address the specific needs and experiences of different stakeholder groups.
- **Iterative design**: Continuously refining solutions based on feedback and real-world experiences to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

#### Specific Patient Experiences

To illustrate the importance of empathy and understanding, let's refer to some specific patient experiences that highlight profound human experiences:

1. **Chronic Illness Management**: Consider a patient with a chronic illness such as diabetes. This patient may face daily challenges in managing their condition, including monitoring blood sugar levels, adhering to medication regimens, and coping with the emotional toll of living with a chronic disease. By empathizing with this patient's experience, innovators can develop solutions that provide better support, such as user-friendly monitoring devices, personalized treatment plans, and mental health resources.

2. **End-of-Life Care**: Another profound human experience is the journey of patients receiving end-of-life care. These patients and their families often face complex emotional and practical challenges. By understanding their needs and experiences, innovators can create solutions that improve the quality of end-of-life care, such as advanced care planning tools, palliative care services, and support systems for family members.

3. **Mental Health**: Mental health patients often encounter stigma, lack of access to care, and difficulties in managing their conditions. By empathizing with their experiences, innovators can develop solutions that reduce stigma, improve access to mental health services, and provide effective support for managing mental health conditions.


### 2. Develop a persona


Imagine you are a director making a movie. To create a compelling story, you need to develop the main character in great detail. This character should feel real, with a rich background, emotions, and daily activities. Similarly, when developing a persona in healthcare entrepreneurship, you need to create a vivid and realistic depiction of a person who embodies the characteristics of your target audience. This process involves understanding their demographics, behaviors, motivations, and challenges.

#### Importance of Delving Deep into Persona Feelings and Underlying Problems

1. **Empathy and Understanding**: By exploring the feelings and underlying problems of the persona, you gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and emotions. This empathy allows you to design solutions that truly resonate with their needs and improve their quality of life.

2. **Identifying Root Causes**: Delving into the underlying problems helps you identify the root causes of the issues faced by the persona. This insight is crucial for developing effective and sustainable solutions that address the core of the problem rather than just the symptoms.

3. **Enhancing User Experience**: Understanding the persona's feelings and daily activities enables you to create solutions that seamlessly integrate into their lives. This enhances the user experience and increases the likelihood of adoption and satisfaction.

4. **Improving Communication**: A well-developed persona helps you communicate more effectively with your target audience. By understanding their language, preferences, and concerns, you can tailor your messaging to resonate with them and build trust.



#### Developing a Full-Fledged Persona
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B23iWg0koi8?si=C7XSl8az0c7aDI9A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Based on the customer profile, you can create one or more personas that represent different segments of your target audience. Here are some steps to develop a detailed persona:

1. **Demographics**: Define the persona's age, gender, occupation, education level, and other relevant demographic information.

2. **Behavior and Lifestyle**: Describe the persona's daily activities, hobbies, and routines. Consider how these behaviors impact their experience with the need statement.

3. **Motivations and Goals**: Identify the persona's motivations, goals, and aspirations. What drives them? What are they trying to achieve?

4. **Challenges and Pain Points**: Explore the challenges and pain points faced by the persona. What are the underlying problems that contribute to these challenges?

5. **Quotes and Dialogue**: Imagine the lines the persona would say. This helps you capture their voice and perspective, making the persona more relatable and realistic.

6. **Visual Representation**: Feel free to sketch or draw the persona and the scenarios where they experience the need. This visual representation can include a timeline of their day (customer journey) and the specific moments when the problem occurs.


###### Example of a Persona

Here is an example of a persona to illustrate the concept:

**Name**: Emily Thompson
**Age**: 28
**Occupation**: Graphic Designer
**Education**: Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts
**Daily Activities**: Emily starts her day with a light breakfast and a short walk to clear her mind. She spends her workday designing graphics and collaborating with her team. In the evening, she enjoys painting and reading books. Emily also attends regular medical appointments and support group meetings.
**Motivations**: Emily is motivated by her passion for art and her desire to maintain a positive outlook despite her health challenges.
**Challenges**: Emily struggles with the physical and emotional toll of breast cancer treatment, including fatigue, anxiety, and managing her work-life balance.
**Quote**: "I want to keep creating beautiful things, even on the days when I don't feel my best."

By developing detailed personas like Emily, you can better understand the needs and experiences of your target audience, leading to more effective and empathetic solutions in healthcare entrepreneurship.


### 3. Mapping out care pathways and patient journeys over time
In this step you need to expand on the movie of the persona. Try to imagine you are making a scence or a key frame in the movie. What timeline would you chooose and how would it look like?

1. **Making Tacit Knowledge Explicit**
   - Gather information from various stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, patients, and other relevant parties.
   - Document clinical care paths, operational procedures, protocols, daily work schedules, and patient activities.
   - Ensure that the knowledge from different perspectives is made explicit and accessible.

2. **Mapping the Knowledge**
   - Use a patient journey format to map out the gathered information.
   - Identify key touchpoints where the problem-solution becomes tangible and impactful.
   - Develop a visual representation of the patient journey, highlighting critical moments and interactions.

3. **Integrating the Knowledge**
   - Analyze the mapped information to understand how the problem manifests itself from different perspectives.
   - Determine how the proposed solution adds value to the patient journey.
   - Ensure that the integration process considers both social and technical elements within the healthcare system.

4. **Choosing a touchpoint and validating it**
   - Validate the identified touchpoints with other stakeholders from the same organization.
   - Compare the touchpoints with other patients' unique experiences and clinical guidelines.
   - Reflect on whether the unique value proposition captures the intended value at the touchpoints and assess its scalability in the target population.

By following these steps, students can create a comprehensive and effective patient journey that addresses real-world challenges in healthcare delivery. Collaborative design and active participation of all stakeholders are crucial to ensure that the innovation meets their needs and concerns.


### 3. Brainstorm

After you have identified a key touchpoint the aim is to brainstorm further in a visual way about the potential solutions you can make to solve that problem.

**What is Brainstorming?**
Brainstorming is a creative process where team members generate a multitude of ideas in a short period. The goal is to tap into the collective intelligence of the group, fostering an environment where creativity thrives, and judgment is temporarily suspended. This allows for a free flow of ideas, which can later be evaluated and refined.

**The Importance of Mindset in Brainstorming**
In healthcare entrepreneurship, the mindset is crucial. Unlike other fields, healthcare entrepreneurs must navigate complex regulatory environments, ethical considerations, and the high stakes of patient outcomes. This requires a unique blend of creativity, resilience, and empathy. The C-space conceptual space, ([Chapter 3](04_stakeholders.md)), is where innovative ideas are born. It involves thinking beyond conventional boundaries and exploring uncharted territories.

**Key Elements of Effective Brainstorming:**

1. **Diverse Perspectives:**
   Encourage participation from team members with different backgrounds and expertise. This diversity can lead to more innovative solutions.

2. **Clear Objectives:**
   Define the purpose of the brainstorming session. Whether it's to solve a specific problem, improve a process, or develop a new product, having a clear goal keeps the team focused.

3. **Structured Environment:**
   While brainstorming thrives on creativity, having a structured approach can enhance productivity. Use techniques like "How Might We" questions to guide the session. For example, "How might we give each patient a personal hospital experience?"

4. **Encourage Wild Ideas:**
   No idea is too outlandish. Sometimes, the most unconventional ideas can lead to breakthrough innovations. Create an environment where team members feel safe to share without fear of judgment.

5. **Use Visual Aids:**
   Utilize whiteboards, post-its, and other visual tools to capture and organize ideas. This helps in visualizing connections and patterns that might not be immediately apparent.

6. **Facilitation:**
   A good facilitator can keep the energy high and ideas flowing. They can introduce variations to the prompt if the team gets stuck and ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute.

7. **Constraints:**
   Adding constraints can spark creativity. For example, "What if there was no internet, no hospital, no care professional?" or "How would Superman do it?" These constraints force the team to think outside the box.

8. **Multiple Rounds:**
   Conduct several rounds of brainstorming, each with a different focus or constraint. This can help in exploring different aspects of the problem and generating a wider range of ideas.

###### The Role of your mindset in these exercises

**Behavior vs. Mindset:**
Previously we differentiated between behaviors and mindsets. While behaviors are the actions we take, mindsets are the underlying beliefs and attitudes that drive those actions. In healthcare entrepreneurship, a growth mindset is essential. This involves being open to learning, embracing challenges, and viewing failures as opportunities for growth.

**C-Space Conceptual Space:**
The C-space conceptual space is where creativity and innovation happen. It's about stepping out of the comfort zone and exploring new possibilities. In healthcare, this might mean rethinking traditional models of care, leveraging new technologies, or finding novel ways to address patient needs.

**Empathy and Patient-Centricity:**
A key aspect of the healthcare entrepreneurial mindset is empathy. Understanding the needs, fears, and desires of patients can lead to more effective and compassionate solutions. This patient-centric approach is what sets healthcare entrepreneurs apart from those in other fields.

###### Practical Exercise

To put these principles into practice, try the following exercise:

1. **Hexagon Brainstorming:**
   Place a post-it with an idea in the center (hexagon with a question mark) and then examples in the hexagons around it. Do this with several ideas and then choose the most interesting ones to paste on the board on the left.

2. **Explore Technology Trends:**
   For inspiration, explore the latest technology trends (see chapter on definitions)

By incorporating these best practices and fostering the right mindset, your team can unlock its full creative potential and drive innovation in healthcare entrepreneurship. 

### 4. Select the idea and create a value proposition for that idea

Brainstorm selection is the process of evaluating and choosing which ideas generated during a brainstorming session to pursue further. While generating ideas can be relatively easy, the challenge lies in selecting the most promising ones to act on. This process can vary in complexity depending on the nature of the brainstorm. For straightforward brainstorms, you might simply pick a few standout ideas. However, for more complex design solutions, the selection process may require more deliberation. It's important not to settle on safe choices alone; instead, select a range of ideas to carry forward into prototyping, aiming to preserve the breadth of solutions generated by the group.

###### How to Select Brainstorm Ideas

1. **Avoid Narrowing Down Ideas Too Quickly**
   - An implausible idea may spark a useful or meaningful insight. Therefore, it's crucial to hang onto ideas that excite, amuse, or intrigue the team.

2. **Selection Techniques**
   - **Voting**: Each team member gets three votes. The ideas with the most marks get selected. This method ensures that the selection process is democratic and that the most popular ideas are chosen.
   - **Funnel with Four Categories**: Choose four categories to help organize and evaluate the ideas. For instance:
     - **The Rational Choice**: Ideas that are practical and feasible.
     - **The Most Likely to Delight**: Ideas that have the potential to surprise and delight users.
     - **The Darling**: Ideas that the team is particularly passionate about.
     - **The Long Shot**: Ideas that are risky but could lead to significant breakthroughs.

Elect one or two ideas within each category to ensure a diverse range of solutions. You can use a diagram with four quadrants to visually represent these categories and help organize the ideas.

   - **Bingo**: Pick one or two ideas that inspire different types of prototypes:
     - **Physical Prototype**: Ideas that can be represented through tangible models.
     - **Digital Prototype**: Ideas that can be developed into digital solutions.
     - **Experience Prototype**: Ideas that can be tested through user experiences.

3. **Evaluating Outlier Ideas**
   - If an idea seems too far-fetched to test, ask what attracted you to it. Then, test that aspect or integrate it into a new solution. This approach ensures that even the most unconventional ideas are given consideration and can contribute to innovative solutions.


### 5. Develop a prototype: Bring your idea to life

Prototyping is a crucial step in transforming ideas from mere concepts in your brainstorm selection into tangible forms. It allows you to visualize, test, and refine your ideas, making them accessible to others. A prototype can take many forms, depending on the nature of the idea and the resources available. It can be as simple as a wall of post-its, a role-playing activity, or a physical object. For instance, it can be:

- A drawing of an integrated digital service
- A mock-up screen of a digital solution
- A sketch of a robot
- A blueprint of a new service
- An algorithm demonstrated through role play with cards
- A picture or video of someone using your solution

In the early stages, it is important to keep prototypes inexpensive and low resolution. This approach allows you to learn quickly and explore various possibilities without significant investment. Prototypes are most successful when they can be experienced and interacted with by the design team, users, and other stakeholders. They serve as a powerful tool to start conversations, gain insights, and drive deeper empathy, ultimately shaping successful solutions.

**Different Types of Prototypes**

Depending on the hypothesis you want to test, you can create specific types of prototypes. Each type serves a unique purpose in validating different aspects of your idea:

- **Functional Prototypes:** These prototypes focus on testing the functionality of your solution. They help you understand how well your idea works in practice and identify any technical challenges.
- **Aesthetic Prototypes:** These prototypes emphasize the visual and sensory aspects of your solution. They are useful for evaluating the design, look, and feel of your idea.
- **Cost Impact Prototypes:** These prototypes assess the cost implications of your solution. They help you determine the feasibility and affordability of your idea.

**Research Approach and Hypothesis Validation**

To effectively validate your assumptions, it is essential to adopt a research approach with a clear hypothesis. This involves defining the key assumptions you want to test and creating prototypes that address those assumptions. By systematically testing and refining your prototypes, you can gather valuable data and insights that inform the development of your final solution.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9WweXofdOJQ?si=KYJ0cQfdW-geP8iP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**How to Prototype**

Prototyping is often thought of as a way to test functionality, but it serves many other purposes:

- **Empathy Gaining:** Prototyping deepens your understanding of users and the design space. By observing how users interact with your prototype, you can gain valuable insights into their needs, preferences, and pain points.
- **Exploration:** Develop multiple concepts to test in parallel. This exploratory phase allows you to compare different approaches and identify the most promising solutions.
- **Testing:** Create prototypes to test and refine solutions. Iterative testing helps you identify flaws and make improvements, ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.
- **Inspiration:** Inspire others by showcasing your vision. Prototypes can be used to communicate your ideas effectively, generating excitement and support from stakeholders.

For the purpose of this course, we do not expect you to develop high-quality prototypes that resemble the final solution. Instead, focus on creating small prototypes to showcase in presentations. This approach is known as paper prototyping or rapid prototyping. 

**Prototyping Tools and Resources**

To prototype in Miro, you can use the drawing or object functions, or you can utilize your own creative materials at home, such as pens, paper, pictures, cardboard, or anything you find relevant. 

You can also develop a prototype with a 3D-printer or a simple setup to develop it at home, see Robin Taen's instructions: https://www.instructables.com/Experiential-Manufacturing-Machines-for-Education/: The Experiential Manufacturing Machines were developed can be configured into small-scale manufacturing machines. Currently, three configurations have been developed, but thanks to its modularity, additional configurations can easily be added in the future. By engaging students with an intriguing, exciting, and versatile machine, they can develop their own prototypes and gain valuable hands-on experience. The machines are developed with a focus on producibility and cost-effectiveness.

Describe a validation plan for each hypothesis, detailing how you will test and measure its accuracy.

Your goal is to validate the viability of your solution within the selected beachhead market and refine your business model based on the insights gained from this testing phase. This will involve estimating market size, pricing strategies, and potential sales volumes to create financial assumptions that project the costs, revenues, and profitability of entering this niche market.

### Applying for grants
It is very important to communicate the stage of your idea clearly (funding bodies would typically call that Technology readiness levels (TRL)), your unique value proposition and the outcomes you would like to achieve. This would have to be translated so that people can understand how it fits in the outcome of their team and organizations. Here it is always important to understand the role of your intellectual property strategy and it is worthwhile to think about how you will balance that in comparison with scientific open communication about your findings.
