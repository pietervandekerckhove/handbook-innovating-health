# 8. The basic innovation cycle: Observe and explore, create and prototype and robustisize and test

Aim: undersatnd and apply Generative co-design sessions + business development tools to guide strategic decisions regarding revenue streams, the behaviors are integrated in these sessions

In the innovation process there is a basic cycle that we can follow:

* Mission driven start

It is essential that you build a mission and vision and try to clarify what the general aim would be. 

It could be a great benefit if you have someone related to your initiative who has been feeling the pain firsthand and wants to make a change.

```{tip}
Try to look for outcomes that matter to patients, tangible and intangible and match that with the outcome that are relevant in the scientific community, for example have a look at the outcomes that are relevant for young adults and adolescents with cancer https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/17/3/454

**The fudamental level of human experience**

It is important to understand how we experience our health and critical events in our life. And there is increasing amount of working being done in the field of human counsiousness to explore what we field as a human being on the experiential level of human awareness. However, the experiential level of human level is only starting to beginning to become integrated in healthcare innovations. 

Watch this TED talk from Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. What is the experiential level of awareness? How do we connect with it?

clinical problem validation, understanding care pathways and patient journeys

When looking at your diagnosis as a patient decades after the diagnosis happened it is interesting how profound the emotions are and how traumatic the impact can be, even if the cancer is cured.

Here is a video of the comedian Tom Green who shared his experience shortly after diagnosis:
[![The Tom Green Show - Cancer Special: Part 1](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWHD3L4RhiGA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHD3L4RhiGA)

[![The Tom Green Show - Cancer Special: Part 2](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsJboRvYDgx8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJboRvYDgx8)


Here is a video of Tom Green who shares his experience decades later:
Why do you feel the pain challenges for Tom were so difficult to deal with? Can you identify different dimensions? Can you differentiate between what is important in his philosophy of life and what matters to society? 

[![  Tom Green: I didnâ€™t expect to survive testicular cancer](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0jso8SJTY_M)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jso8SJTY_M)

```{tip}
Research tools to prepare a qualitative interview: check out the generative AI tool called the Autonomous customer inteviewer made by prof Dries Faems: https://automaticinterviewerpublic-owoskccwim2h9e5nynhsix.streamlit.app/ 
```



### Data analysis
To properly analyse the data you can use generative AI or automation tools to transcribe interviews and analyze them. This is what a startup focused on called Qaring (folded). 

You could also use validated AI research tools to review large bodies of literature like ASReview https://asreview.nl/. Here are some open exercises https://github.com/asreview/asreview-academy?tab=readme-ov-file#open-teaching-materials

Research tools to analyse a qualitative interview: check out prof Dries Faems and Niklas Geiss generative AI based cool "Expert & Resaerch Interview Helper": https://niklasg27-interview-helper-interview-helper-v0-4-90hctr.streamlit.app/
```

Advanced level:
Try to gather input about the patient journey in a very detailed manner to work out a patient-level cost analysis of the pathway to quantify the paintpoint even better.
For example, see this paper mapping subfertility pathways by dr. Maura Leusder: Patient-level cost analysis of subfertility pathways in the Dutch healthcare system  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-024-01744-5



## Create: prototyping technology and engineering

Different types of prototypes

## Testing with strategic hypotheses

need for research approach with hypothesise to validate assumptions with prototype

Validation prototype types: functional, aesthaethic, cost impact

starting simple validation to more complex validation
1. early in practice validation

Try a feasibility like this Virtual reality application combined with neurofeedback (see Rolbiecki, A. J., Craig, K., Polniak, M., Smith, J., Ghosh, P., & Mehr, D. R. (2023). Virtual reality and neurofeedback for Management of Cancer Symptoms: a feasibility pilot. American Journal of Hospice and Palliative MedicineÂ®, 40(3), 291-298.)


2. early HTA And evidence gathering for prototyping evalutation strategy and clinical evalutation strategy

```{tip}
Look for creative places in your organization, like the Create4Care lab at Erasmus MC or Rotterdam Square validation processes, you can use to validate clinical aspects of your innovation
