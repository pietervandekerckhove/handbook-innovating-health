## Why do we need to innovate healthcare through entrepreneurial behavior?
Healthcare is a sector that is constantly evolving, with daily innovations transforming the way we provide and receive care. However, despite this continuous stream of new ideas and technologies, the innovation process in healthcare is often flawed ([Collins et al., 2023](#collins)). Some innovations with great potential are never realized, while others, which are clearly not beneficial for the user and sometimes not sustainable, such as electronic medical records, are implemented. This raises the question: what is going wrong in the healthcare innovation process?

In this book, we explore the core issues that hinder the innovation process in healthcare. We ask whether using entrepreneurial behaviors and healthcare management theories like design thinking, front-loading theory, and innovation theory could offer a solution. But it seems already all this knowledge is readily available and described in the scientific literature? So how come it is not used in practice? For instance, design thinking is in some ways already being used in healthcare, albeit not explicitly, so is it not being applied correctly?

Through in-depth analyses, case studies, and interviews with experts, we provide insights into how the innovation process in healthcare can be improved. Our goal is to offer a guidebook for successful innovation that is not only technologically advanced but also sustainable and patient-centered ([EURAM, 2025](#euram)).


## What is healthcare entrepreneurship and why is it different from other types of entrepreneurship?

Similar to other newer fields in health research, like health economics, health entrepreneurship draws on existing fields like economics, operations, management and innovation theory, and implementation science. It is becoming increasingly a stand-on its own field ([Gloveret al., 2024](#glover); [Wilden et al., 2018](#wilden); [Burns, 2012](#burns)).

### Key Differences in Healthcare Entrepreneurship:
- **Constant Demand and Flow of Needs**: Unlike other industries where demand can fluctuate, healthcare consistently experiences high demand due to the ongoing need for medical services and wellness solutions. This creates a unique environment where innovation must be continuous and responsive.
  - There is a growing population that lives with multiple conditions and a mental health condition ([OECD, 2025](#oecd)). 
- **Regulation and Market Principles**: Traditional economic systems are governed by managed market principles and regulations that dictate how businesses operate. Healthcare, however, navigates a complex regulatory landscape that often requires compliance with multiple, sometimes conflicting, regulations, making entrepreneurial ventures more challenging ([Fassbender et al., 2024](#fassbender)).
- **Multiple Stakeholders**: In healthcare, there isn't a single payer or client. Instead, entrepreneurs must address the needs of a diverse group of stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, insurers, and regulatory bodies. This multifaceted environment demands a nuanced approach to management and innovation.

### Contrast with Traditional Views:
- **Entrepreneurship**: Traditional entrepreneurship often focuses on market-driven demand and competition. In healthcare, the focus shifts to patient-centered care and addressing the constant flow of needs, requiring a more empathetic and service-oriented approach.
- **Management**: Management theories in other fields typically emphasize efficiency and profitability. In healthcare, management must balance these goals with regulatory compliance and ethical considerations, making it a more complex and sensitive endeavor.
- **Innovation**: Innovation in traditional industries often revolves around technological advancements and market trends. In healthcare, innovation must prioritize patient outcomes and safety, often requiring collaboration with medical professionals and adherence to strict regulatory standards. For instance, in a retail market, often the newest and best solution and technologies can be pushed on the market, and the risk is lower compared to a healthcare context, that people will still buy it. In a healthcare setting, the government may decide that only certain providers can prescribe that intervention due to budget impact reasons (see CAR-T innovations).


Given the unique challenges and dynamics of healthcare entrepreneurship, developing innovation pathways requires a distinct strategy that diverges from standard views. The constant demand for healthcare services necessitates continuous innovation to meet evolving patient needs and improve outcomes. Unlike traditional industries, healthcare must navigate a complex regulatory environment, ensuring compliance while fostering innovation. Additionally, the involvement of multiple stakeholders—patients, providers, insurers, and regulators—demands a collaborative approach to innovation, prioritizing patient safety and ethical considerations. Therefore, healthcare entrepreneurship must adopt a strategy that integrates empathy, regulatory knowledge, and stakeholder collaboration to effectively develop and implement innovative solutions that address the multifaceted needs of the healthcare ecosystem.


### Healthcare entrepreneurship: unique collaborative behaviors
Healthcare entrepreneurship is emerging as a field ([Glover et al., 2024](#glover)). Before it was often discussed in the field of management and entrepreneurship as a context in which the management and entrepreneurship theories are applied. Often this happens on the macro and meso level across a health system or on a meso level across organizations. In this book we are focusing on the behaviors of healthcare entrepreneurship, and specifically on an individual level within healthcare organizations.

Entrepreneurial behavior in healthcare is also implicitly present in the fields of healthcare management, (technical) medicine, biomedical-engineering, and life sciences. However, these fields are looking at the objects, clinical procedures, patient outcomes and outputs of the innovations.

**We are looking at the underlying unique collaborative behavior that results in improved outputs and outcomes.**

## Why value driven innnovation?

Healthcare systems around the world are facing immense pressure to become more resilient due to unprecedented challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact, and additional demands from demographic changes and technological advancements are adding to the strain. To effectively address these pressures and innovate effectively, we need information from various stakeholders. We need to collaborate with stakeholders from bottom-up.

We are collecting information about health spending, financing, clinical quality, and safety of care, but we are still missing a crucial voice of patients. Ultimately this results in the insights from patients remaining tacit in health practice, recorded in self-reported outcomes or narratives and stories. They don't make it to care practice, as we are not aware how to effectively drive their insights from an idea to an integrated sustainable patient-driven solution.

Patient-centered care is not new, however patient-centered entrepreneurship focusing on the innovation process is new. It focuses on the transdisciplenary processes to deliver that patient-centered care, which has always been argued to be essential in healthcare. The challenge we face today is ensuring that healthcare services and innovations truly deliver their promised value to patients. Despite the focus on patient-centered care, many health services and innovations ultimately fail to meet patients' needs and expectations.

Ultimately, the field of patient centered care aims to bring:

1. **Enhanced Resilience and Adaptability**: By incorporating patient feedback and experiences, healthcare entrepreneurs can develop solutions that are more resilient and adaptable to changing demands. This approach ensures that healthcare services are not only effective in treating diseases but also in improving the overall well-being of patients.

2. **Improved Quality of Care**: Traditional metrics such as mortality and morbidity rates, while important, do not capture the full spectrum of patient experiences. Patient-centered entrepreneurship focuses on delivering better outcomes and experiences of care by considering patients' perspectives, leading to higher quality and more personalized healthcare services.

3. **Unique value**: Patient-centered entrepreneurship encourages innovation by highlighting areas where patients feel underserved or dissatisfied. By addressing these gaps, entrepreneurs can create novel solutions that better meet the needs of patients, ultimately driving progress and improvement in healthcare systems.

In conclusion, patient-centered healthcare entrepreneurship offers a transformative approach to healthcare management by prioritizing the voices and experiences of patients. This shift not only enhances the resilience and adaptability of healthcare systems but also improves the quality of care and fosters innovation in healthcare solutions.

## The need to integrate scattered innovation and entrepreneurship knowledge

On an individual patient level, the knowledge about strategies and management approaches to develop innovations in healthcare is scattered across different stakeholders. Therefore there is need for a comprehensive book to summarize and bring these insights together. A prime example of the power of such a strategic knowledge became apparant during the COVID-19 crisis. We witnessed unprecedented, rapid, and coordinated innovation efforts at every level of the healthcare system. Stakeholders from across the sector—patients, clinicians, researchers, regulators, and policymakers—mobilized to develop new solutions in record time. This included:

* Temperature measurement solutions
* Sanitizing alcohol solutions
* Mask production and distribution
* Large-scale vaccination centers
* High Throughput Rapid lab analysis techniques
* Fast-tracked vaccine development, regulatory approval, and market access

However, once the crisis subsided, many of these integrated innovation pathways dissolved. Today, healthcare innovation continues, but often in fragmented and incremental ways rather than through large-scale transformational efforts.

For example, some efforts focus on human-centered patient experiences by enhancing electronic medical records and health data transparency, yet these solutions often remain siloed within specific institutions. There are also rapidly changing landscapes  in emerging fields in intervention discovery and development and new ways of delivering care with biotech and ICT: e.g. synthetic, genetic, and cellular laboratory techniques, machine learning, additive manufacturing, extended reality, theranostics. 

Some innovations are also coming from other industries into healthcare, technological advances such as medical drones for transporting blood and emergency equipment require harmonization of legislation, technology, infrastructure, and care pathways before they can be widely implemented ([MAVLab, 2023](#mavlab); [Helicus, 2023](#helicus); [TU Delft, 2023](#tudelft)). Consider, for example, the ambulance drone concept—an unmanned aircraft that delivers defibrillators to cardiac arrest patients within minutes. While technically feasible, the innovation pathway from prototype to scalable, integrated solution remains unclear. What financial models, regulatory approvals, and operational frameworks are needed to bring such an idea to real-world implementation?

This handbook aims to bridge this gap between these fragments of knowledge and best practices, equipping you with the tools and frameworks to design and implement scalable, sustainable innovation pathways in healthcare.

Ultimately the impact of helping entrepreneurial people on an individual level become more entrepreneurial may have a ripple effect in the healthcare organizations. A recent study found that 

## Strategy to guide the expedition of health innovators in the trenches

Healthcare entrepreneurship on an individual level is generally an emerging field in research and education. Yet, it could have great consequences if people with entrepreneurial ambitions learn how to become more entrepreneurial. For instance, this study found that residency directors thought that entrepreneurial skills could help medical professionals in training to become better doctors: ([Tam & Dong, 2021](#tam)).

This may have a ripple effect in the healthcare organizations. A recent study found that people with an entrepreneurial ambition increase the rate of entrepreneurship among their peers ([Hacamo & Kleiner, 2024](#hacamo)).

We need to train the future generation of responsible health innovators to ensure that they learn from these strategic innovation pathways so that their innovations achieve real impact. This is especially true for digital health, which is expected to become a cornerstone of healthcare transformation in the coming decade ([Friend et al., 2023](#friend); [Weimar et al., 2024](#weimar); [Technology Foresight, n.d.](#technology)). However, despite its potential, most digital health solutions fail to integrate meaningfully into healthcare systems ([Lee et al., 2021](#lee)).

A recent review of digital healthcare innovation found that efforts focus primarily on making existing care processes more efficient, rather than driving structural transformation ([Kraus et al., 2021](#kraus)) As a result, only a small number of digital tools—such as online data-sharing platforms and video consultations—have gained widespread adoption, despite these technologies existing for decades. Compared to other heavily regulated industries like retail (which integrates well-being and prevention programs) or aerospace (which advances medical logistics via unmanned aircraft), healthcare's digital transformation is lagging ([Compton-Phillips, 2024](#compton)).

Even within leading technology-driven institutions like TU Delft, students are often trained to develop novel technological solutions from an outsider’s perspective (a “technology push” approach). However, they struggle to connect these inventions to real-world healthcare challenges, as they lack formal training in innovation management, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory integration ([Smulders et al., 2019](#smulders); [Chakraborty et al., 2021](#chakraborty)).

To address these issues, we must train future innovators to design holistic innovation pathways—structured approaches that front-load the knowledge of diverse stakeholders to develop solutions that are:

* Scalable, meaning they can transition from small-scale pilots to widespread adoption
* Sustainable, both financially and environmentally, ensuring long-term impact
* Stakeholder-driven, integrating patient, clinician, and policymaker insights from the outset



**The Key to Holistic Innovation Pathways: Front-Loading Stakeholder Knowledge**

One of the most critical elements in designing effective innovation pathways is integrating diverse stakeholder knowledge at the very beginning of the innovation process. Healthcare innovation is inherently fragmented, with different stakeholders holding tacit knowledge that is often siloed and difficult to access.

A major factor in early-stage innovation failure is that potential problems are only identified late in the process—often after significant investment has been made. To increase the likelihood of success, we must front-load these challenges, bringing together key actors at the start to anticipate roadblocks and co-create viable pathways forward.

We need to integrate different stakeholder's knowledge by facilitating social interaction processes that bring together entrepreneurs, researchers, patients, care professionals, technology experts, and policymakers. This collaborative approach ensures that innovations do not remain theoretical but instead find practical application in real-world healthcare systems.

By integrating stakeholder knowledge effectively, we can design innovation pathways that are not only technically and economically feasible but also socially and environmentally sustainable. This is the approach that this book aims to equip you with—providing the tools, frameworks, and methodologies needed to move from invention to integration in healthcare innovation.

**Key Learning Outcomes**

This book will help you achieve the following learning objectives:

* Analyze and map innovation pathways for in-house ventures within hospitals, effectively leveraging key resources such as patients, care professionals, and executives to drive decision-making and implementation.
