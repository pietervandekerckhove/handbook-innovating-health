## Introduction
Healthcare organizations operate in a system with an endless demand for healthcare services. Unlike other industries, they are not necessarily incentivized to innovate for increased turnover or higher-quality care. Given this context, it is crucial to create dedicated spaces and frameworks that enable innovation while aligning with the broader organizational mission.

## Orchestrating dedicated fuzzy conceptual spaces in a rigid knowledge organization
In a healthcare organizations, many different stakeholders, like care professionals are often implicly being creative. Creativity is situated and a living thing as dr. Milene Goncalves describes (see Cascini, G., Nagai, Y., Georgiev, G. V., Zelaya, J., Becattini, N., Boujut, J. F., ... & Wodehouse, A. (2022). Perspectives on design creativity and innovation research: 10 years later. International Journal of Design Creativity and Innovation, 10(1), 1-30.). For example creativity is situated in care organizations as care professionals often need to look for the best treatment for the patient. Yet, often the problem is not clear and there are multiple possible diagnoses and not one treatment. In a way, it requires them often, albeit very briefly, to be creative and collaborate and share ideas, often in multidiscplenary team meetings. However, to innovate, one needs to enlarge that space and find ways to incorporate that innovative thinking more in the organization. If creativity could exist in Type 1 (quick ideas) and Type 2 (refinement and judgement), Goncalves and Cash propose that it could be better to have more iterations of the quick ideas and come up with better ideas (ADD REF Gonçalves, M., & Cash, P. (2021). The life cycle of creative ideas: Towards a dual-process theory of ideation. Design Studies, 72, 100988.). If one is aware of these tendencies in practice, it can help to develop better ideas.

Yet, creating that space and time in a safe way in a complex regulated organization is challenging. From a theoretical point of view the organization must make space to think beyond the existing knowledge. That means, moving from a knowledge space to a conceptual space as Hatchuel and Weil have described (REF Hatchuel, A., & Weil, B. (2003). A new approach of innovative Design: an introduction to CK theory. In DS 31: Proceedings of ICED 03, the 14th International Conference on Engineering Design, Stockholm.) 

Leading health care organizations have developed an innovation spaces to experiment with new ideas outside their usual operational scope. For instance, Mayo Clinic’s Center for Innovation fosters design-driven healthcare improvements (TA Change APA REF [Yale Insights](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/can-design-thinking-reshape-an-esteemed-institution)). Erasmus Medical Centre has a special unit Create4Care where you can walk-in and prototype your idea and they also are growing their hospital based incubater and validation program. (ADD KEY REF). The Munich University Hospital uses a simulation space:

Some hospitals also apply these design thinking principles actively, Kaiser Permanente applies human-centered design to improve patient experiences and streamline care deliverythe specialized Rotterdam Eye Hospital also witnessed the changes of using design thinking to understand the human perspective and the personal connection to improve health care experiences (ADD REF Deichmann, D., & Van der Heijde, R. (2017). How design thinking is improving patient-caregiver conversations. Harvard Business Review.).(add also REF Roel van der Heijde https://roelrotterdam.nl/blog/how-design-thinking-is-improving-patient-caregiver-conversations/)

 By embedding innovation teams within their operations, they ensure that new ideas are tested and implemented in real-world healthcare settings. However, tensions often arise between care professionals focused on traditional medical practice and those who take a more entrepreneurial or design-oriented approach. Tim Brown (IDEO) and dr. Nicholas LaRusso (Mayo Clinic) highlight the importance of bridging science, design, and healthcare through design thinking.

What are the key challenges discussed in the video for healthcare organizations to use design thinking?

But, how do that on an individual level? It may just be worthwile to have people do a small meditation exercise to become more creative. (see REF Schootstra, E., Deichmann, D., & Dolgova, E. (2017). Can 10 minutes of meditation make you more creative. Harvard Business Review.). For further reading see: Goleman, D., & Davidson, R. J. (2018).

## Developing a Strategic Starting Point
To successfully introduce innovation in the organization, it is important to connect to a broader mission. The organizations need a purpose-driven mission that aligns with  trends and strategies that are influenced by other stakeholders, like the government policies, such as:
- **Value-Based Healthcare** – Enhancing patient outcomes while managing costs.
- **Cost Efficiency** – Streamlining healthcare delivery to optimize resource use.
- **Provider-Driven Innovation** – Encouraging frontline professionals to identify and implement new solutions.


## Synergizing Innovation with Organizational Behavior
Healthcare organizations are often hierarchical, heavily regulated, and accustomed to incremental rather than radical innovation. Given these constraints, successful innovation requires:
- **Navigating Administrative Structures** – Understanding regulatory and operational boundaries.
- **Identifying Key Stakeholders** – Engaging leadership, clinicians, and administrative staff at different levels.
- **Aligning with Leadership** – Securing buy-in from executives and department heads.

## Look for change leaders to champion your quest
Once key individuals are identified, assessing their personalities and motivations is essential to identify early partners or leaders of cha

nge in the organizaiton (see NEJM Catalyst ref on leading by example). Resources such as *Healthcare by Design: A User’s Guide to Healthcare Improvement* (Barry Katz et al., 2025) provide tools looking for like-minded people with the right characteristics for healthcare innovation.

## Communication and pitching your idea to different people in the organization

Explaining the innovation mission to various stakeholders requires tailored communication strategies. Given the complex social dynamics of healthcare, innovators need sufficient resources to facilitate discussions and integrate new ideas into existing frameworks. Research suggests that fostering collaborative communication is key to successful implementation ([Smulders, Lousberg, & Dorst, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1108/17538370810883819)).

Different people in the organization will have different incentives to focus on innovation and changes next to their core activities. That is why it is crucial to use those 20 seconds or 1 minute ot your maximum advantage. Try to come across in a professional way.

## Conclusion
Innovation in healthcare organizations requires a strategic approach that aligns with existing structures, engages key stakeholders, and fosters a culture conducive to change. By leveraging purpose-driven missions, effective communication, and strong leadership, organizations can create sustainable innovation pathways that improve healthcare delivery.
