## Introduction

Innovation pathways in healthcare play a critical role in determining how new medical technologies, treatments, and interventions move from concept to implementation. Understanding these pathways allows innovators to design effective strategies, anticipate challenges, and optimize the development process. This chapter explores the relevance of innovation pathways, outlines the traditional biomedical innovation model, highlights the need for improvements in digital health and service-based innovations, and introduces key theories such as the IDER model and front-loading theory to enhance innovation strategies.

## The Traditional Biomedical Innovation Pathway

The dominant biomedical innovation pathway follows a structured, often linear, process that includes fundamental research, preclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, and market introduction. This pathway has been well-established for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, ensuring safety, efficacy, and compliance with strict regulatory standards. Key steps in this process can be seen in the USA health system described with Figure 1 of this JAMA article https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820562.

In the phase before the marketing stage, one needs to gain access to the market. Every country has its own procedure for this. Have a look at this video by dr. Frederick Thielen about key issues that are happening in practice to go beyond the market access launch and get to a succesfull launc where patients actually get a new drug prescribed. What things should you consider upfront in this innovation pathway?

[![3 Things About Market Access](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8NhuaohK_Qg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NhuaohK_Qg)


A key challenge here is to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of your drug, for example in The Netherlands. But what is cost-effectiveness? 

Look at this video from dr. Frederick Thielen:

While this pathway has proven effective for traditional medical products, it does not always accommodate the complexities of emerging innovations such as software-driven interventions (e.g., digital therapeutics like Germany's DiGA framework (**ADD REF**)) or theranostics (e.g., diabetes management integrating biomarkers and digital drug delivery). 

In Germany the new digital health assessment framework is an emerging step for digital health innovations.

```
````




These new categories demand more flexible, iterative innovation models. Ijzerman, Koffijberg, Fenwick, and Krahn (2017) emphasize the importance of early health technology assessment in medical product development, highlighting the need for more adaptive frameworks (PharmacoEconomics, 35(7), 727‚Äì740).

## Beyond Pharma and Medtech: The Need for Improved Pathways

More Complex Product-Service Combinations

Innovation in healthcare now extends beyond pharmaceuticals and medical devices to include complex, service-oriented digital health solutions. Digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics, and virtual interventions using extended reality (XR) require pathways that account for evolving regulatory frameworks, interdisciplinary integration, and shifting healthcare dynamics. The traditional model must adapt to support parallel innovation processes that accommodate both technological and socio-economic considerations. Therefore, we need to rethink healthcare innovation models to effectively integrate these complex product-service combinations into routine care.

The Need for New Innovation Theories to Revise This Framework

A stronger theoretical foundation is required to improve innovation processes, especially in terms of translating ideas into care practices. Healthcare innovators must ultimately be able to reshape systems to support the adoption and sustainability of novel solutions. This also applies to the traditional biomedical innovation pathway, whereby the alst part market launch is in reality a black box. Few people really knows, what it takes for a drug to be fully become available to the market of a country. 

During these complex negotiations you need to agree on a price with the payer, be it a health insurer, the government or a hospital, or all of these together. Have a look at this video from prof. Carin Uyl-de Groot:

```

Compton-Phillips (2024) emphasizes the importance of care delivery innovation in achieving this transformation. Underneath we will explore a few key theoreties one can use to help understand key dynamics in innovation pathways.  Ultimately it requires integrating service design principles, systems thinking, early health technology assessment, and implementation science. This can than develop frameworks that better support their healthcare innovations beyond traditional pharmaceutical and medtech pathway.

Underneath, we briefly describe these theoretical building blocks and later we will refer back to these theories to show how we applied them.

## Innovating is moving between the knowledge space and the conceptual space (C-K theory)

C-K theory (Concept-Knowledge theory), introduced by Hatchuel and Weil, offers a unified design framework that distinguishes between the space of Concepts (C) and the space of Knowledge (K), modeling innovation as the co-expansion of these spaces. Unlike traditional problem-solving approaches, C-K theory defines design as the generation of new concepts that challenge and extend existing knowledge, rather than merely selecting optimal solutions. The framework identifies four key operators (C‚ÜíK, K‚ÜíC, C‚ÜíC, K‚ÜíK), forming a ‚Äúdesign square‚Äù that captures the iterative and dynamic nature of innovation.  

(ADD REF Hatchuel, A., & Weil, B. (2003). A new approach of innovative Design: an introduction to CK theory. In DS 31: Proceedings of ICED 03, the 14th International Conference on Engineering Design, Stockholm.)

```

In healthcare innovation, C-K theory can help move beyond conventional pharmaceutical and medtech pathways. By structuring the innovation process around the interplay between conceptual exploration and knowledge structuring in an organization, this approach supports the development of more adaptive and interdisciplinary healthcare solutions. 

Looking at the innovation process in the healthcare organization, one could say that the operational space, is similar to the K space as it involves low uncertainty and it is decideable. However, there is also an innovation space, where things are much less certain. Have a look at the video of prof. Frido Smulders:

Building on the C-K theory, how the different levels of value creation (see previous chapter) in the health system have different levels of innovation behaviour with different timeframes:

## The paralel process: IDER Model: Parallel Processes in Innovation

The innovation process considered from a C-K perspective can be framed in four paralel processes. The IDER model: Initiation, Design, Engineering, and Realization, proposed by Smulders (2022), challenges the notion of linear innovation pathways. Instead, it presents innovation as a set of interconnected, parallel processes that evolve dynamically. This approach acknowledges that various aspects of innovation (e.g., technological development, regulatory considerations, and market readiness) progress simultaneously rather than sequentially. Understanding this non-linear structure helps innovators navigate complex innovation ecosystems effectively.

(ADD FIGURE HERE)

## Getting it right from the start: Front-Loading Theory

In this paralel IDER process, it is important to strategically decide how to begin. Front-loading theory emphasizes the importance of identifying key challenges early in the innovation process. Mapping potential bottlenecks‚Äîsuch as regulatory hurdles, sustainability concerns, workforce integration, and ethical considerations‚Äîat the outset allows for proactive problem-solving. Dolfsma, Eijk, and Mahdi (2022) highlight that investing effort and resources early can mitigate risks and improve overall success rates in medical technology innovation.

Implementing Front-Loading Theory

Front-loading can be operationalized through several strategies:

* Strategic Problem-Solution Co-Evolution ‚Äì Innovators should iteratively refine both the problem definition and the solution approach in response to emerging insights.

* Circular Pathway ‚Äì Incorporating continuous feedback loops ensures that innovation pathways remain adaptive and responsive to real-world needs.

* Parallel Process Integration (IDER Model) ‚Äì Balancing multiple development streams prevents bottlenecks and accelerates time-to-market.

* Ethical and Societal Considerations ‚Äì Incorporating ethical principles early, as discussed by Jeroen van den Hoven and Stefan Buijsman, ensures that innovations align with societal values and long-term sustainability (see WHO report on AI ethics: WHO AI Ethics Report and OpenWHO course: Ethics and AI).

## Choosing long-term partner organizations: Herzlinger's Three Strategies

Regina Herzlinger (2024) identifies three primary strategies to support  healthcare innovation:

* Internal Development ‚Äì Leveraging in-house expertise and infrastructure to refine innovation early.

* Growth Driver Strategy ‚Äì Partnering with healthcare institutions and regulatory bodies to ensure alignment with market and policy requirements.

* External Collaboration ‚Äì Engaging external stakeholders, such as academic institutions and technology firms, to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and capabilities.

## Managing the innovation process within the organization with key stakeholders: Generative co-design

Collaborative design follows a general desing thinking process:

(ADD FIGURE HERE)

Vandekerckhove et al. (2023) underscores the importance of integrating diverse knowledge of different stakeholder through a generative co-design processes. Generative co-design is one of the most interactive design methods to integrate the deeper conceptual knowledge (C space) of different stakeholders move it to a more explicit idea discussion, whereby the knowledge is made explicit (K space). In design terminology this iterative process between the C and K space would be called a co-evolution process. This method involves stakeholders actively in the design process to ensure that the developed solutions are user-centered and meet real-world needs. Vandekerckhove et al. also discuss how this theoretical framework can help us to decide how a good stakeholder group should be assembled:e.g. the type of stakeholders we involve in the entrepreneurial innovation activities.
For example: Application Example in Health Innovation for Young Adults with Cancer
Imagine a design team aiming to develop a new digital health platform for young adults with cancer. Using C-K theory, the process might unfold as follows:
 
1. **Concept Generation (C)**:
   - The team begins with the concept of a digital platform that addresses the unique psychological and social needs of young adults with cancer, beyond just medical treatment. This is an open-ended idea that requires further exploration.
2. **Knowledge Exploration (K)**:
   - The team conducts a literature review and engages with oncologists, psychologists, and cancer patients to gather existing knowledge. They find that young adults with cancer often face isolation, mental health challenges, and a need for peer support (Knowledge).
 
3. **C-to-K Transformation**:
   - The initial concept is refined based on the gathered knowledge. The team develops a more concrete idea: a mobile app that includes a social networking feature, mental health resources, and personalized content for young adults with cancer. This transformation is informed by their findings about user needs and existing technological capabilities.
4. **K-to-C Expansion**:
   - Using their existing knowledge of mobile app development and user interface design, the team generates new concepts. They brainstorm additional features such as virtual support groups, telemedicine integration, and gamified health tracking.
5. **C-to-C Evolution**:
   - The team engages in iterative design thinking sessions, where they continuously expand and refine their concepts. For instance, they might explore the idea of incorporating AI-driven personalized content suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.
6. **K-to-K Integration**:
   - As they test prototypes with users, they gather new data and insights, which expand their knowledge base. They learn about specific user preferences and challenges, such as the need for anonymity in support groups or the importance of easy navigation for users undergoing treatment.
 
#### Example in Practice
**Developing a Health App for Young Adults with Cancer**:

**Step 1: Initial Concept (C)**:
   - The team starts with a broad concept: a supportive digital environment tailored to the needs of young adults with cancer.

**Step 2: Gathering Knowledge (K)**:
   - Research and interviews reveal that these patients often feel isolated and crave connection with peers who understand their experience.

**Step 3: Refined Concept (C-to-K)**:
   - Based on this knowledge, the concept evolves into an app with social networking features, access to mental health professionals, and community events.

**Step 4: Generating New Concepts (K-to-C)**:
   - Leveraging their knowledge of digital health technologies, the team brainstorms additional features like telemedicine consultations and mood-tracking tools.

**Step 5: Iterative Expansion (C-to-C)**:
   - The team prototypes these features and conducts user testing, continuously refining the app. They might add new features like AI-driven health tips based on user activity.

**Step 6: Knowledge Integration (K-to-K)**:
   - Feedback from testing informs the next iteration. They discover, for instance, that users prefer video support groups over text-based forums, leading to further refinement and knowledge integration.

By applying C-K theory in this way, the design team can effectively navigate the complexities and uncertainties of creating a health innovation tailored to young adults with cancer, ultimately developing a more impactful and user-centered solution.
Research by Pieter Vandekerckhove highlights the transformative potential of generative co-design in healthcare, such as improving cardiology consultations through enhanced user experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (Vandekerckhove et al., 2020). Generative co-design, as elaborated by Vandekerckhove et al. (2020) in their systematic literature review, is a participatory approach that involves users throughout the design process. This methodology ensures that the final product is shaped by the needs and preferences of its users, leading to more effective and user-friendly health interventions.



## Conclusion

Innovation pathways in healthcare are evolving to accommodate new technological and service-driven advancements. Traditional biomedical models provide a foundation but must be expanded to support parallel processes, digital solutions, and ethical considerations. By applying the IDER model, front-loading theory, and Herzlinger‚Äôs strategic approaches, innovators can navigate complex pathways more effectively, leading to more successful and impactful healthcare solutions.

It is important to assess the roadblocks for existing solutions and learn from their mistakes in their pathways: today one could couple the existing interventions that can help with diagnostics and couple them with new interventions.

Re-mission 2 showed benefits in terms of improved adherence to treatment and indicators of cancer-rleated self-efficacy and knowledge in young people with cancer, and it seems that they did not apply for FDA approval. A potential strategy could be to use a middle-growth strategy and work with pharmaceutical companies to leverage support for market access in conjunction with an existing or new treatment.
