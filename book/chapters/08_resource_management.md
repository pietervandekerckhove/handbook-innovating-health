Try to understand what kind of money you need to survive and how the financial revenue streams look like. 

Map out the different revenue streams on different levels, care organization, wider network of organizations on a regional and national level: e.g. does the ward have an innovation budget? The hospital? the health insurer? the government?


```{tip}
Start assessing and modelling how your innovation can reduce costs, many hospitals are looking to be more efficient within the given budget by the health insurer, look at the case of a circular healthcare initiative that made the business case by showing how they reduced costs to the hospital by reusing medical waste material here on page 91 in the open textbook 'Creating a circular healthcare ecnomomy' : https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/1507

strategy for research funding in first five years (See slides Steve)

There are different type of funding you can look for:
* pre-seed funding: see for example funding to improve and develop the idea towards a prototype (see K voucher funding)
* larger public funding grants (EU): see the strategic themes on an EU level
* crowdfunding strategies
* Venture capital investments

Strategically it is important to look for organizations that can provide financial support in different ways and who understand your mission about value-based healthcare:

## A focused financial strategy: identifying a beachead market

Using your resources wisely is important, especially in the beginning as you could invest in developing your idea with more research, building a functional prototype or running a feasibility test. It could be used to build a minimum viable product.

From wide vision for the unique value proposition to focus on a beachhead market strategy

After you have the wide vision try to bring focus on the first entry point of your value proposition where the interests of all stakeholders align. For instance, you may have developed a fantastic scalable idea, but now you need to look into how to make it very small and actionable to focus all your efforts to get a first cashflow: a beachead market strategy


### TAM SAM SOM
Calculating your adressable beachhead market can be done in three steps

Exercise: what could be the beachead strategy for this intitiative? The Unique value proposition support to manage chronic disease crisis during treatment with a virtual avator who providesa a mindfulness intervetion
```

```{tip}
When pitching your idea to investors, irrespective of the level, it is important to use the right terminology and show the right numbers. It is a good practice to start from the TAM SAM SOM calculations to show the market size. check out these videos here https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-innovation-entrepreneurship
