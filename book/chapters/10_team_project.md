### Communicate your ideas and applying for grants
It is very important to communicate the stage of your idea clearly (funding bodies would typically call that Technology readiness levels (TRL)), your unique value proposition and the outcomes you would like to achieve. This would have to be translated so that people can understand how it fits in the outcome of their team and organizations. Here it is always important to understand the role of your intellectual property strategy and it is worthwhile to think about how you will balance that in comparison with scientific open communication about your findings. 

Strategic

(see CSBB MINOR materials)

You may not be familiar with academic essay writing. That's ok, here are some tips:

* You can watch a few videos about academic writing from TU Delft open education library
* TA: ask permission and include video with exercise underneath:
https://ocw.tudelft.nl/course-lectures/academic-writing-general-pitfalls-getting-started/

 Try to use this structure:
* Introduction with a question or statement
* You answer your questions and you use scientific references to substantiate your argument
* you conclude with one sentence about the key message of your essay

Tips for a grant proposal:
* assemble a team with a track record in your area, preferably one or more key partners has access to patients, clinical trial administration and care professionals
* assemble a writing team and meet regularly to develop your grant proposal
* align your proposal with the criteria of the funding body: e.g. for EU grants, it is important to take into account the larger EU Competitive theme into account: https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness_en
